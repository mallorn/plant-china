铺地狼尾草",
1.**Pennisetum clandestinum** Hochstetter ex Chiovenda",

> This is a most unusual species of *Pennisetum* with a highly reduced inflorescence. The bristles must be searched for within the uppermost leaf sheaths. The anthers emerge at night on their long filaments and are visible in the morning as a grayish white haze over the sward.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This species is widely introduced in upland areas of the tropics and subtropics on fertile soils as a pasture and lawn grass (Kikuyu Grass). It has now become an invasive, difficult to eradicate weed in some parts of the world.
