> The typical subspecies is described above. A second subspecies, *Calamagrostis anthoxanthoides* subsp. *laguroides* (Regel) Tzvelev (which name has never been transferred to *Deyeuxia*), occurs in Tajikstan. It is distinguished by a somewhat laxer, paler panicle and a lemma less than 2/3 as long as the glumes.
