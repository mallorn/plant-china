临桂猕猴桃",
52.**Actinidia linguiensis** R. G. Li & X. G. Wang",

> Introduced from Wantian Village, Lingui Xian in 1991, this species is cultivated in the research orchard of the Guangxi Institute of Botany, Guilin. The name was not validly published by Li and Wang in 2003 because no type was indicated (*Vienna Code*, Art. 37.1). *\"Actinidia wantianensis\"* (R. G. Li &amp; L. Mo, Guihaia 23: 201. 2003) also belongs here but was not validly published for the same reason.
