> The protologue appears to indicate two types. However, rather than regard the name as invalid, we consider the first-cited, flowering type (&lt;I&gt;Exped. Wuyi 2414&lt;/I&gt;, IBSC, as “Typus fl”) to be the holotype because it is immediately followed by an explicit citation of two isotypes (IBK, PE, as “Isotypus”). We consider the second-cited, fruiting type (&lt;I&gt;Exped. Wuyi 00585&lt;/I&gt;, IBSC, as “Typus fr”) to be a paratype.

## Description
Shrubs or small trees, 4–10 m tall. Branchlets dark gray when old, slightly curved, terete, sparsely pubescent when young, glabrous when old; buds reddish purple, ovoid, glabrous, rarely scales sparsely pubescent at margin. Stipules caducous, linear-lanceolate, membranous, adaxially sparsely pubescent, margin entire, apex acuminate; petiole 1.5–2.5 cm; leaf blade elliptic or ovate-elliptic, 5–10 × 2.5–4 cm, sparsely pubescent when young, glabrescent, base rounded or broadly cuneate, margin obtusely serrate, apex acute or acuminate. Corymb umbel-like, 4–5.5 cm in diam., 5–7-flowered; bracts caducous, lanceolate, membranous, glabrous, margin entire, apex acuminate. Pedicel 3–5 cm, glabrous. Flowers ca. 2.5 cm in diam. Hypanthium obcampanulate, glabrous, prolonged into short tube at apex. Sepals triangular-lanceolate, ca. 8 mm, ca. as long as or slightly longer than hypanthium, abaxially glabrous, adaxially tomentose, margin entire, apex acuminate. Petals purplish white, obovate, 1–2 cm, base shortly clawed, apex rounded. Stamens ca. 30; unequal, slightly shorter than petals. Ovary 5-loculed, with 2 ovules per locule; styles 5, slightly longer than stamens, white tomentose basally. Pome yellowish red, globose, 1.5–2.5 cm in diam., core free; fruiting pedicel 1–3 cm, glabrous; distal part of hypanthium tubular, 5–8 mm; sepals persistent. Fl. May, fr. Aug–Sep.
