## Description
Climbing vines, to 5 m. Stems slightly woody, glabrous or sparsely adpressed or spreading hairy. Leaves 17-27 cm; peti-ole 7-11 cm with abundant hairs like on stem; stipels 2-3 mm, slender; leaflets thinly papery, adaxially glabrous or with very sparse long adpressed hairs, hairs abaxially sometimes less sparse, lateral veins 4-6 pairs, rather straight but curving near margin; terminal leaflet rhombic-ovate, 6-13 × 4-9.5 cm, base rounded or slightly cuneate, apex acuminate; lateral leaflets 8-14 cm, width ratio of abaxial to adaxial halves 2:1, base trun-cate. Inflorescence axillary, 7-27 cm, nodes 6-15, all crowded into upper 1/5-1/2 of inflorescence; lower part of inflorescence without bracts or scars; pedicels 7-8 mm, densely clothed with spreading reddish short fine hairs and light yellow adpressed hairs; bracts and bracteoles lanceolate, linear-lanceolate, or nar-rowly ovate, ca. 7 × 2 mm, hairy outside, late caducous often only shortly before flowering. Calyx densely clothed with dense pale short fine hairs inside and outside and sparse irritant red-dish bristles outside; tube 5-6 × 8-10 mm; lateral lobes ca. 2 mm, lowest lobe 3-4 mm, all narrowly triangular, upper lip often indistinct. Corolla deep purple or reddish brown (often drying brown rather than black); standard broadly elliptic, 2-2.5 cm; wings oblong, 3.2-4 cm × 9-12 mm, often as long as keel, apical 2/3 of adaxial surface with abundant long fine golden hairs; keel (3.6-)4(-4.5) cm, apex sharply curved. Legume nar-rowly oblong, narrowing to base and apex and scarcely in-dented transversely between seeds, asymmetric in outline, slightly downcurved, 6.5-10 × 2-2.5(-3) cm, 5-8 mm thick, leathery, densely covered with reddish irritant bristles when young, later with pale spreading fine pubescence and sparser reddish bristles, both margins with pair of wings 2-4 mm wide but of irregular width giving slightly jagged outline, both sur-faces with 12-16 well-spaced obliquely transverse narrow thinly textured winglike lamellae of irregular height to 3 mm, some-times erratically interrupted, sometimes running into wings. Seeds 2-5, deep reddish brown or black, ca. 11 × 9 mm, markedly laterally flattened, ca. 7 mm thick, smooth; hilum black, length ca. 5/8 of circumference; aril absent. Fr. Apr-May.
  "Reference": "*Mucuna lamellata* is distinguished by its rhombic-ovate leaves, its corolla wings with conspicuous long hairs on most of the adaxial surface, and its lamellate legume that is smaller and relatively much nar-rower than most lamellate-fruited species. Its fruit is similar only to *M. cyclocarpa*, which differs in the cordate leaflets, the usually larger al-most spherical seeds, and the legume distinctly indented between seeds. *Mucuna hainanensis* sometimes has fairly short but always wider leg-umes with more markedly oblique lamellae, seeds twice the size, and ovate leaves. Flowers on dried specimens are often distinctively \"dirty brown\" in color.*Mucuna lamellata* is distinguished by its rhombic-ovate leaves, its corolla wings with conspicuous long hairs on most of the adaxial surface, and its lamellate legume that is smaller and relatively much nar-rower than most lamellate-fruited species.

1个果实插图。编者在核查标本时，发现所依据之标本陈思恩 C. N. Chun 2152，比较残缺，只有几片脱落小叶，两段折断的花序，并且未曾正式发表。WHmot-Dear发表《中国及日本黧豆属修订》一文时，未见到宁油麻藤。本属前一作者，最近见到郑万钧2484号标本，于1932年10月21日采于南京宝华山，标本比较完整，并有1荚果，经唐进、汪发缵于1953年7月鉴定为Mucuna paohwashanica，见到此标本后，始知宁油麻藤实为褶皮黧豆Mucuna lamellata Wilmot-Dear，因而将宁油麻藤归并于褶皮黧豆。褶皮黧豆顶生小叶为菱状卵形，荚果长在10厘米以下。江苏植物志所载宁油麻藤，其顶生小叶卵形，荚果长达14厘米，宽约3.5厘米，插图上果实为褶襞较多较密，与《图说》描述，陈思恩、郑万钧所采，唐、汪所鉴定之标本不符。江苏植物志所依据之标本的仍待查考。
