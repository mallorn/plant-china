Inflorescences terminal, subcapitate to congested-cymose, several flowered, subsessile to sessile, glabrous to densely hirtellous; bracts triangular to ligulate, 1-3 mm; pedicels to 2 mm. Flowers subsessile to pedicellate. Calyx glabrous; hypanthium portion turbinate, ca. 1 mm; limb ca. 1 mm, lobed for 1/3-1/2; lobes deltoid to narrowly triangular. Corolla in bud white, funnelform, glabrous outside; tube ca. 1.5 mm, villous inside; lobes triangular-oblong, ca. 1.5 mm. Drupes becoming red then black, ellipsoid to obovoid, 8-10 × 6-8 mm, with pedicels to 7 mm; pyrenes smooth or very shallowly 3- or 4-ribbed. Fl. Apr, fr. Aug.
