## Description
Herbs, perennial, low, unarmed, rhizomatous, sometimes with fetid odor. Raphides present. Leaves opposite or sometimes basalmost pairs reduced to prophylls, without domatia; stipules persistent, interpetiolar and fused to petioles, triangular or 3(or 5)-lobed, often glandular-dentate. Inflorescences terminal and in uppermost leaf axils (or subtended by leaflike bracts), fasciculate and 2- to several flowered or sometimes 1-flowered, pedunculate or subsessile, bracteate or bracts reduced. Flowers pedunculate or pedicellate, bisexual, apparently monomorphic. Calyx limb deeply 5-lobed, usually markedly reticulate-veined, with lobes often unequal. Corolla white or purplish red, slenderly tubular-funnelform to salverform, inside glabrous or pubescent in throat; lobes 5, valvate-induplicate in bud. Stamens 5, inserted at base of corolla tube, included to exserted; filaments short to developed; anthers dorsifixed. Ovary 4- or 5-celled, ovules 1 in each cell, anatropous on basal placentas; stigmas 2-, 4- or 5-lobed, exserted. Fruit capsular, obconic to hemispherical, papery, dehiscent through apical lid or operculum within persistent calyx limb, with pedicels becoming reflexed; seeds 3-5, obovoid, longitudinally grooved (or with many longitudinal idioblasts containing raphides).

Lo (in FRPS 71(2): 153-155. 1999) reported one species from China, *Pseudopyxis heterophylla* Maximowicz, with morphological characters that include some characters of both *P. heterophylla* and *P. depressa* Miquel as treated by the Fl. Japan (3a: 229. 1993). These two species were both reported there to be endemic to Japan: *P. depressa* with a height of 3-8 cm, uniformly distributed stem pubescence, purple corollas 20-25 mm, very short filaments, and 5 stigmas; and *P. heterophylla* with a height to 50 cm, stem pubescence arranged in lines, white corollas 6-7 mm, developed filaments, and 2 stigmas.H.
