> *Loxogramme avenia* is very similar to *L. involuta* and *L. cuspidata*, but it differs from the former by the smaller, dark brown scales and from the latter by the abundant paraphyses.

## Description
Rhizome shortly creeping, more than 3 mm in diam., densely scaly near apex and at base of stipes; scales dark brown, lanceolate, 5-10 × 0.5-1.2 mm, margin entire. Fronds in tufts, monomorphic; stipes indistinct, dark castaneous when dry; lamina abaxially paler, adaxially green, lanceolate, 15-25 × 1-2.5 cm or more, broadest at middle to upper portion, narrowed below, thick and leathery, fleshy, abaxial surface with sparse brown, 2-celled glandular hairs, adaxially glabrous, base decurrent to 2-5 mm from base of stipe, margin recurved, apex acuminate; costa distinctly raised abaxially, hardly raised adaxially, pale green to brown; veins hardly visible on both surfaces, forming copious anastomoses. Sori 8-20 pairs, linear, 1-2 cm, 3-4 mm apart, oblique, continuous in middle between costa and margin of frond, slightly sunken into lamina; paraphyses many, dense, longer than sporangia, completely covering sori initially. Spores ellipsoid-monolete.
