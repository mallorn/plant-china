## Description
Rhizome creeping. Culms tufted, slightly slender, clothed with red-brown, bladeless sheaths. Leaves usually rather narrow. Involucral bracts scalelike or lowermost one leaflike, linear, rarely setiform, nearly not sheathed or very shortly sheathed. Spikes 2-5; terminal spike male, rare species with 2 male spikes, linear-lanceolate, lanceolate, or clavate; lateral spikes female, ovate, broadly ovate, or subglobose, subdensely flowered, sessile or rarely shortly pedunculate. Female glumes red-brown or yellow-brown, margins broadly hyaline. Utricles obliquely patent or eventually divaricate, obovate or elliptic-obovate, obtusely or inflated trigonous, glabrous, rarely hispid, shiny, shortly beaked, orifice obliquely truncate, emarginate, or shortly 2-toothed. Nutlets tightly enveloped; style base slightly thickened; stigmas 3.
