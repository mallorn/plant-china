22.**Rhododendron subsect. Fulgensia** D. F. Chamberlain",

> The circumscription of *Rhododendron* subsect. *Fulgensia* is problematic. Whereas *R*. *fulgens* is perfectly distinct, both *R*. *miniatum* and *R*. sherriffii are closely allied to species in *R*. subsect. *Thomsonia*, though with leaves abaxially densely hairy.
