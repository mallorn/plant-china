## Description
Shrubs, subshrubs, or vines, unarmed, usually extensively twining, usually with fetid odor when bruised. Raphides present. Leaves opposite or infrequently in whorls of 3 or 4, without or sometimes with (*Paederia foetida*, *P. spectatissima*) pubescent domatia; stipules caducous or persistent, interpetiolar, triangular to bilobed. Inflorescences axillary and/or terminal on main stem or often on short lateral stems, thyrsiform, paniculate, cymose, or spiciform, several to many flowered, sessile to pedunculate, bracteate with bracts sometimes enlarged and stipitate [to petaloid]. Flowers sessile to pedicellate, bisexual, monomorphic. Calyx limb (4 or)5(or 6)-lobed [sometimes with calycophylls]. Corolla white, pink, or purple, funnelform to salverform usually with tube very slender then abruptly enlarged shortly above base, inside pubescent in tube and throat, sometimes fenestrate near base; lobes (4 or)5(or 6), induplicate-valvate in bud, with margins often crisped to irregular, rarely shortly trifid at apex. Stamens (4 or)5(or 6), included, inserted at various levels near middle of corolla tube, included; filaments reduced [or sometimes developed]; anthers dorsifixed. Ovary 2(or 3)-celled, ovules 1 in each cell, erect, basal, anatropous; stigmas 2, filiform, included or exserted. Fruit characteristic: dry, drupaceous becoming schizocarpous, globose or compressed globose to compressed ellipsoid, with calyx limb persistent and occasionally becoming enlarged; exocarp dry, membranous to papery, usually drying shiny, at maturity fragmenting; pyrenes (\"diaspores\") 2(or 3), indehiscent, membranous to leathery, hemispherical to flattened, oblong to ovate in outline, entire to winged, rarely pubescent (*P. yunnanensis*), sometimes borne on a persistent carpophore; seeds with testa thin; cotyledons broadly cordate; radicle short, hypogeous.
  "Reference": "*Paederia* was studied in detail by Puff and collaborators (in Puff, Opera Bot. Belg. 3: 1-376. 1991). They recognized three subgenera based on corolla morphology and size, anther position, style length, the presence of petaloid bracts, and fruit morphology. Two of their subgenera are found in China: *P.* subg. *Paederia*, which is restricted to SE Asia and includes *P. cavaleriei*, *P. foetida*, *P. pertomentosa*, and *P. stenobotrya*; and *P.* subg. *Alatopaederia* Puff, which is found worldwide except continental Africa and includes the remaining Chinese species. Puff (loc. cit.: 207-292) presented a species-level taxonomy of Asian *Paederia* that differed significantly from that of other authors, including W. C. Ko (in FRPS 71(2): 110-119. 1999). In particular, he recognized fewer species, circumscribed *P. foetida* more widely, and accordingly synonymized several names. Puff also applied the name *P. foetida* differently than previous authors, and his conclusions were not adopted in FRPS: he applied the name *P. foetida* to plants treated by W. C. Ko (loc. cit.: 118-119) as *P. scandens*, and he included the plants treated as *P. foetida* by W. C. Ko (loc. cit.: 112-113) in *P. cruddasiana*. Puff (loc. cit.: 216-220) discussed in detail the confusion of these species and the typification of *P. foetida* and synonymized *P. scandens* under *P. foetida*. The treatment here follows Puff, which is well documented and internally consistent, and thus is distinct from traditional taxonomy of SE Asian *Paederia*.*Paederia* was studied in detail by Puff and collaborators (in Puff, Opera Bot.
