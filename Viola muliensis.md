Leaves broadly ovate or triangular, very rarely orbicular, 1.5-4.5 × 2-8 cm, papery, both surfaces green and glabrous, base truncate to widely cuneate, rarely widely cordate, 3-pedatipartite to 3-5 mm from base; middle partition rhombic or broadly linear, base cuneate or narrowly cuneate, apex acuminate, undivided, margin 2- or 3-dentate in upper part, sometimes 2- or 3-fid to 6-7 mm from base, lobes laxly 2- or 3-incised-lobulate; lateral partitions rarely undivided, margin 2- or 3-dentate, rarely entire, often unequally 2- or 3-fid, lobes 2- or 3-lobulate. Basal leaves 1-4, sometimes withered, long petiolate; petioles 2.5-14 cm, glabrous. Cauline leaves similar to basal ones but petioles shorter and blades smaller upward.
