Culms 45–100 cm, 2–3 mm in diam.; internodes subterete, 3–4 cm, glabrous, grooved above branches; nodal ridge raised. Culm sheaths deciduous, papery, glabrous; auricles and oral setae absent; blade subulate, 3–6 mm. Branches 3–5 per node, 0.8–1.5 cm, 3–5-noded, with persistent prophyll at base; branch sheaths gradually deciduous, membranous; blade small, mucronate. Leaves 1 or 2 per ultimate branch; sheath ca. 2 cm, lower sheath longer than upper in 2-leaved branches; ligule conical, tightly involute, ca. 5 mm and weakly curved in solitary or upper leaves, shorter in lower ones; blade lanceolate, 8–12 × 0.8–1.5 cm, abaxially pubescent, adaxially glabrous, base cuneate, margins minutely serrulate, apex acuminate, caudate. Flowering branches at lower nodes of leafy branches, sometimes with 2–5 secondary branches, each branch subtended by a large spathelike bract and with an axillary prophyll and 1–4 pseudospikelets; pseudospikelets linear, 1.5–2 cm, comprising a prophyll, 1–3 gemmiferous bracts or lowest bract empty, and a terminal spikelet. Spikelets with 3–5 florets, lower 1 or 2 fertile, others male or sterile. Lemma pale green, lanceolate, ca. 1.2 cm, thin, 11-veined; palea thinner, about as long as lemma; lodicules membranous, transparent. Anthers yellow. Ovary narrowly ellipsoid; style 1; stigmas 3.
