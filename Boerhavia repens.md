> This species is often confused with *Boerhavia* *diffusa*. It can be most readily distinguished by the lack of multicellular hairs along the leaf margins, consistently pedicellate flowers, and much paler perianth. It differs from *B*. *erecta* by the very differently shaped fruit. This is a pantropical, ruderal weed, mainly growing in dry areas.

## Description
Herbs ephemeral to perennial. Stems prostrate, radiating from taproot, to 50 cm, most parts eglandular-puberulent. Petiole to 1 cm; leaf blade 1-2.5 × 0.4-1.5 cm, abaxially conspicuously pale, base rounded to cuneate, margin entire, apex rounded to subacute. Inflorescences mostly axillary, 2-5-flowered umbels, sometimes gathered into cymes, to 2 cm. Pedicel to 1 mm. Perianth limb white, pink, or pale purple, to 1 mm. Stamens (1 or)2(or 3).
