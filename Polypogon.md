棒头草属",
89.**Polypogon** Desfontaines",

> *Polypogon* is closely related to *Agrostis*, with which it hybridizes. It is distinguished mainly by its deciduous spikelets falling with a slender, basal stipe attached.

## Description
Annual or perennial. Leaf blades linear, flat; ligule membranous. Panicle contracted to dense and spikelike, often bristly with numerous small deciduous spikelets. Spikelets with 1 floret, laterally compressed, without rachilla extension, falling entire, pedicel or upper part of it articulated and remaining attached to spikelet as a stipe; glumes equal, longer than floret, papery, scabrid, 1-veined, apex entire to 2-lobed, often with slender awn from apex; lemma about 1/2 as long as glumes, rounded, thin, smooth, shiny, obscurely 5-veined, veins usually shortly excurrent from truncate apex, awnless or with fine subapical awnlet or geniculate dorsal awn; palea 1/2 as long to equaling lemma. Stamens 1–3.
  "Statistics": "Twenty-five species:warm-temperate regions of the world and on tropical mountains, especially in damp places; six species (one endemic) in China.

**8.棒头草属*——Polypogon Desf.**

Desf. Fl. Atlant. 1: 66. 1789.

一年生草本。秆直立或基部膝曲。叶片扁平。圆锥花序穗状或金字塔形；小穗含1小花，两侧压扁，小穗柄有关节，自节处脱落，而使小穗基部具柄状基盘；颖近于相等，具1脉，粗糙，先端2浅裂或深裂，芒细直，自裂片间伸出；外稃膜质，光滑，长约为小穗之半，通常具1易落之短芒；内稃较小，透明膜质，具2脉；雄蕊1-3，花药细小。颖果与外稃等长，连同稃体一齐脱落。

约有6种，分布于两半球的热带和温带地区。我国有3种。部分种类用作饲料。

模式种： Polppogon monspeliensis (Linn.) Desf.产于法国。
