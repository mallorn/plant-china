Petiole 1-2(-4?) cm, terete; leaf blade elliptic, oblong, or oblong-lanceolate, broadest at middle or slightly apically, (11-)14-17 × (2.5-)3-5.5[-9] cm, both surfaces sparsely pubescent with stellate trichomes, eventually glabrous except along veins, secondary veins 6-8 on each side of midvein, reticulate veins obvious, base cuneate to narrowly cuneate, apex nearly rounded to acuminate and with a 5-12-mm tip. Inflorescences terminal, sparsely branched panicles, (8-)12-35 cm, at first erect then drooping; axis shortly pubescent to shortly tomentose; bracts linear, 3-6 mm, trichomes like those on axis.
