法氏早熟禾(原变种)",
73a.**Poa faberi var. faberi**",

> Type material at BM and K is heterogeneous. Three of the syntypes differ clearly from *Poa sphondylodes* by the very thin, soft stems and leaves, the uppermost leaf sheaths almost reaching the panicle, and the rather long panicle branches. Although the fourth syntype has the uppermost node in the lower 1/3 of the culm, it matches *P. sphondylodes* in being robust with thick, dense culms and leaf blades and a narrow, dense panicle. Moreover, some of them have an unwebbed callus.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The type of *Poa paucifolia* looks like normal *P. faberi* var. *faberi*. The protologue and syntypes of *P. prolixior* do not differ significantly from *P. faberi*.
