Inflorescences axillary, 1-flowered or 2- or 3-flowered in each axil, congested-cymose, glomerulate, or fasciculate, 4-8 mm in diam., sessile to subsessile; bracts acicular to lanceolate, 1-2.5 mm, entire or marginally scaberulous; pedicels to 1 mm. Flowers sessile to subsessile, apparently homostylous. Calyx glabrous; hypanthium portion subglobose to obovoid, ca. 1 mm; limb lobed nearly to base; lobes linear-lanceolate, triangular, or spatulate, 1.5-2 mm, ciliolate. Corolla white, funnelform, outside glabrous; tube ca. 2 mm, pubescent in throat; lobes narrowly spatulate-oblong, 1-2 mm. Anthers exserted, ca. 1 mm. Stigma 0.2-0.3 mm.

Rev. *Hedyotis*. 2004) considered that a distinct species and treated these plants as *H. angustifolia*. Unfortunately, they presented no discussion of this situation nor details of the actual identity and range of \"true\" *H. tenelliflora*; consequently, their conclusion is not yet accepted here.This species has been treated by most authors as *Hedyotis tenelliflora*; however, Dutta and Deb (Taxon.
