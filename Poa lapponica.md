> Hybridization between *Poa nemoralis* and *P. palustris* is very common in the northern parts of Eurasia. Both species form numerous cytological races, and apomixis is common. Members of this agamic complex are here accepted as a separate, polytypic species of ancient origin and stabilized by apomixis and selection, which needs to be distinguished from the products of recent hybridization and for which the name *P. ×intricata* Wein can be used.
