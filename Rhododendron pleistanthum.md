极多花杜鹃",
58.**Rhododendron pleistanthum** E. H. Wilding",

> This species is close to *Rhododendron* *yunnanense*, and has been treated by recent Chinese authors (e.g., in FRPS 57(1): 73. 1999) as a synonym of it. However, *R*. *pleistanthum* can be distinguished by the puberulent young growth and by the lack of cilia or bristles on the young leaves and petioles.
