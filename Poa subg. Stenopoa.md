5.**Poa subg. Stenopoa** (Dumortier) Soreng & L. J. Gillespie",

> The Chinese species belong to four sections: *Poa* sect. *Secundae* V. L. Marsh ex Soreng (species no. 64); *P.* sect. *Pandemos* Ascherson &amp; Graebner (species no. 65); *P.* sect. *Tichopoa* Ascherson &amp; Graebner (species no. 66); and *P.* sect. *Stenopoa* Dumortier (species nos. 67–81). The other two sections in the subgenus, namely *P.* sect. *Abbreviatae* Nannfeldt ex Tzvelev and *P.* sect. *Oreinos* Ascherson &amp; Graebner, do not occur in China.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many species in *Poa* sect. *Stenopoa* hybridize easily, and have formed a series of morphologically and genetically distinct populations. These are supposed to have been stabilized by apomixis. The situation is made more complex by *P. glauca*, *P. nemoralis*, and *P. palustris*, which are represented by many cytological races of vague taxonomic status. These have hybridized with other species of *P.* sect. *Stenopoa* to form agamic complexes, which are supposed to have arisen quite long ago, perhaps during the Pleistocene (Tzvelev, Fl. European Part USSR 1: 117–368. 1974). Four of these have differentiated sufficiently to be treated as the distinct hybridogenous species *P. albertii*, *P. araratica*, *P. lapponica*, and *P. urssulensis*. Some polytypic species are also accepted. Their subspecies are geographically separated; some may be of hybrid origin, but are close to one parent as result of introgression.

## Description
Perennials, tufted, some with thin, short rhizomes, sometimes stoloniferous (*P.* sect. *Pandemos*) or strongly rhizomatous (*P.* sect. *Tichopoa*). Shoots extra- and intravaginal. Culms usually rounded, sometimes strongly compressed (*P.* sect. *Tichopoa*), smooth or scabrid. Leaf sheaths mostly closed for 1/20–1/6(–1/4 in *P.* sect. *Pandemos*) of length; leaf blades flat, thin, soft to folded or inrolled, firm and hard. Panicle lax to very dense, and spiciform, branches with dense short prickles on angles. Spikelets 3–5(–8) mm, florets 1–3(–8); vivipary absent; rachilla smooth, warty or pubescent; both glumes 3-veined; lemma soft, usually pubescent at least on keel and marginal veins, sometimes also lower part between veins, rarely entirely glabrous; veins slightly raised; callus webbed to glabrous or with a short crown of hairs; palea usually smooth, sometimes pubescent between keels, keels with short prickles, very rarely proximally ciliate. Anthers (1–)1.2–2 mm.
