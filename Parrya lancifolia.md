> The records of &lt;I&gt;Parrya pulvinata&lt;/I&gt; Popov in FRPS and Fl. Xinjiang. (2(2): 176. 1995) were based on misidentified plants of &lt;I&gt;P. lancifolia&lt;/I&gt;. True &lt;I&gt;P. pulvinata&lt;/I&gt; is distributed in Kazakhstan. The above record of &lt;I&gt;P. lancifolia&lt;/I&gt; from Xinjiang is based on Wu 418 (KUN), Liston et al. 837-2 (MO), and Ludlow 689 (BM). The last specimen includes eight plants, of which three are densely glandular and five eglandular.
