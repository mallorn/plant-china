19.**Euphorbia hispida** Boissier",

> *Euphorbia hispida* is included in this Flora on the basis of a single collection, *Ducloux 4686*, in Paris (P). The distinctive indumentum superficially resembles that of *E. hirta* but the hairs are uniformly long, not a mixture of long and very short.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of us (Ma) does not agree with the treatment of this species here.

## Description
Herbs, annual, to 15 cm. Stems decumbent or prostrate, softly hispid. Leaves opposite; stipules divided into 2 or 3 linear lobes; petiole almost absent; leaf blade elliptic, both surfaces softly pilose, base obliquely rounded, margin sharply serrulate, apex obtuse. Cyathia single or on short leafy shoots; involucre turbinate, glabrous; glands 4, purplish, transversely ovate, appendages white or pink, obtusely 2- or 3-lobed, as wide as gland.
