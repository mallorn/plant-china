## Description
Herbs, perennial. Rhizomes creeping, short, stout, with numerous fibrous roots; aerial stems erect, simple, glabrous, with large scales at base. Leaves peltate, large, 3-9-parted or lobed. Inflorescence of few fascicled flowers or a subumbel. Flowers perfect, nutant. Sepals 6, membranous, caducous. Petals 6, dark purplish red. Filaments decumbent, flat; anthers introrsely dehiscent; anther connective wide and usually prolonged; pollen grains 3-colpate, subspheroidal or suboblate, sexine thicker than nexine, foveolate. Pistils solitary; ovary 1-loculed; ovules numerous; stigma globose. Berry red or purplish red. Seeds numerous, without arils. 2*n* = 12.

Mature leaves 2, glabrous, membra-nous, abaxially glaucescent, adaxially dark green, shiny; lower leaf trapezoid, 4-lobed, sinuses shallowly undulate, margin minutely toothed, apex of lobes shortly acuminate; upper leaf roughly pentagonal, with 4 obvious and 2 obscure lobes, ca. 20 cm across. Inflorescence inserted on petiole of upper leaf ca. 2 cm below blade, 7-flowered. Pedicel thin, 4-6 cm, swollen near apex, densely hairy. Sepals narrowly ovate, ca. 14 × 6 mm, margins membranous. Petals 6, reddish purple, ovate-lanceo-late, 10-12 × 5-6 mm, apex acute or slightly toothed. Stamens 6, ca. 1 cm; filaments flattened, 2-3 mm; anthers 6-7 mm, apical mucro 1.5-2 mm.

On the basis of petal size and leaf blade color, Shaw (in Stearn, Gen. *Epimedium*, 285-286. 2002) distinguished *Podophyllum glauces-cens* (\"petals less than 1.2 cm; leaves abaxially glaucous\") from *P. difforme* and *P. versipelle* (\"petals more than 1.5 cm; leaves abaxially pale green\"). Shaw (loc. cit.) also speculated that *P. glaucescens* may be of hybrid origin from a cross between those two species, which he dis-tinguished from each other by their leaf lobes and flower number (*P. difforme* with \"upper leaf irregularly and indistinctly lobed; inflores-cence 1-3-flowered\" vs. *P. versipelle* with \"upper leaf 4-7-lobed; inflo-rescence 4-9-flowered\"). &lt;/dd&gt;&lt;dt&gt;&lt;b&gt;Podophyllum hemsleyi&lt;/b&gt; J.

Leaves 2, abaxially glau-cous green, adaxially dark green, to 35 cm in diam., lobed to 4/5 of radius, sinuses rounded, lobes spatulate-oblong, abaxially with prominent main veins, margin with fine teeth, apex of lobes rounded, tip acute to acuminate. Inflorescence inserted on petiole ca. 2 cm below blade, 4-flowered. Pedicel glabrous, 3-4 cm, dilated to 2 mm wide below receptacle. Sepals ovate-lan-ceolate, 14-16 mm, outer sepals 6-8 mm wide, inner sepals 3-4 mm wide, glabrous, entire, apex rounded. Petals dark red, 3-3.5 cm, oblong-spatulate, widest below apex, entire, apex rounded. Stamens 6; filaments flattened, 7-8 mm; anthers 9-10 mm. Ovary globose to pyriform, 6-7 × ca. 4 mm; style 2-3 × ca. 1 mm; stigma globose, corrugated, 3-5 mm across. Berry and seeds unknown. &lt;p class=Distribution&gt;&amp;#9679; Forests; 1500-1800 m.

<p style=''text-indent:24px''>　　属模式种：Dysosma pleiantha (Hance) Woodson

约7种，为中国特有属，分布于我国亚热带常绿阔叶林带的范围，约当北纬23°32°与东经94°-122°之间。其中1种往南分布至越南北部。

经作者对该属中文名称的考订(1979)，中国古代“本草”所指的“鬼臼”应是 Dysosma 属植物，很可能包括六角莲 Dysosma pleiantha (Hance) Woodson 与八角莲 D. versipellis (Hance) M. Cheng ex Ying 二个种，故该属中文名称采用鬼臼属。
