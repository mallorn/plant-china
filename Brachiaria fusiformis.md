> The Chinese population of this little-known species has larger spikelets than specimens from tropical SE Asia, but is otherwise typical. In the Philippines the spikelets have an apical fringe of longer hairs, but other *Brachiaria* species are also variable in this character. The very slender, triquetrous rachis and contracted, acuminate spikelet apex are unusual in the genus.

## Description
Annual. Culms loosely tufted, branching, 30–50 cm tall, basal internodes purplish, pubescent, upper internodes glabrescent. Leaf sheaths densely pilose; leaf blades lanceolate, 4–5.5 × 0.7–0.9 cm, densely pilose, base rounded, margins cartilaginous, scaberulous and spinulose, apex acute; ligule 0.5–1.5 mm. Inflorescence axis 6–8 cm, pubescent; racemes 4–5, 3–5 cm, narrowly ascending to suberect, lowermost with basal racemelets; rachis triquetrous, 0.3–0.4 mm wide; spikelets single, their own length apart or overlapping; pedicels setose. Spikelets narrowly elliptic, 3.8–4 mm, with a 0.3–0.5 mm basal stipe, herbaceous, softly pubescent, strongly veined, apex sharply contracted, shortly acuminate; lower glume 1/2 spikelet length, clasping, 3–5-veined, obtuse; upper glume as long as spikelet, 5-veined, cross veinlets toward apex; lower lemma similar to upper glume, back flat to slightly sulcate; upper lemma shorter than spikelet, inconspicuously punctate-rugulose, apex acute, minutely scabrous-pubescent, slightly crested.
