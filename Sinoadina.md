## Description
Trees, unarmed; buds rounded. Raphides absent. Leaves opposite, decussate, usually with domatia; stipules caducous, interpetiolar, broadly triangular in outline, deeply bifid. Inflorescences terminal and in axils of uppermost leaves, capitate with 7-11 globose heads in a cymose arrangement, many flowered, pedunculate with peduncles occasionally articulate though usually ebracteate in upper half, bracteate; bracteoles filiform to filiform-clavate. Flowers sessile, bisexual, monomorphic. Calyx limb 5-lobed; lobes obtuse. Corolla yellow, salverform to slenderly funnelform, pubescent inside; lobes 5, thinly imbricate in bud. Stamens 5, inserted in upper part of corolla tube, partially exserted; filaments short; anthers basifixed. Ovary 2-celled, ovules 4-12 in each cell on axile placentas attached in upper third of septum; stigma obovoid, exserted. Fruiting heads globose. Fruit capsular, obconic, septicidally dehiscent into 2 valves from base to apex with valves separating along sides or from base to apex and away from persistent septum, sometimes later splitting loculicidally into 2 more valves, stiffly cartilaginous, with septum persistent or tardily deciduous, with calyx limb persistent on septum; seeds several, medium-sized, fusiform to spatulate, slightly to rather strongly flattened, winged at both ends.
  "Reference": "Ridsdale (loc. cit.) described the arrangement of the corolla lobes in bud as \"valvate but subimbricate at the apex\"; on the specimens studied these appear to be imbricate with the margins very thinly overlapping, a condition sometimes called \"subimbricate\" or \"thinly imbricate\" elsewhere in this treatment (e.g., *Timonius*). Ridsdale described the seeds as \"trigonal to tricornute, slightly bilaterally compressed, not winged,\" but the seeds on the specimens studied are flattened and shortly winged at the ends (e.g., *Fang 8106*, MO; *Tsui 756*, MO).Ridsdale (loc. cit.) described the arrangement of the corolla lobes in bud as \"valvate but subimbricate at the apex\"; on the specimens studied these appear to be imbricate with the margins very thinly overlapping, a condition sometimes called \"subimbricate\" or \"thinly imbricate\" elsewhere in this treatment (e.g., *Timonius*).
