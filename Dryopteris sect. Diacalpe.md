## Description
Plants terrestrial, moderate-sized. Rhizome short, ascending to erect, densely clothed with castaneous scales; scales broadly lanceolate, entire, with a few clavate, short hairs on adaxial side. Fronds tufted; stipe long and densely covered with brown scales, with thick longitudinal groove; lamina ovate or narrowly ovate, tripinnate to quadripinnatifid, papery, dark brown or green when dry, basal pinnae largest, pinnules anadromous; pinnae narrow, regular upward, pinnules catadromously arranged; ultimate pinnules with salmon pink or yellow globose glands along veins abaxially, sparsely covered with short nodose hairs adaxially; rachis and rachillae covered with small scales and short nodose hairs, grooved on adaxial side; veins free, pinnate, veinlets submarginal. Sori globose, basal or abaxial on basal acroscopic veinlets of ultimate pinnules, one in each ultimate pinnule; indusium inferior, globose, castaneous, leathery, enclosing sori when young, dehisced into 2 or 3 valves from top when mature; apophyses elevated, semicircular; sporangia with thin stipe, annuli longitudinal and interrupted, consisting of 14-16 thickened cells; spores bilateral, narrowly elliptic, with coarsely ribbed perispore. *x* = 41.
