## Description
Perennials with well-developed or rarely short stems, rarely subshrubby, with bifurcate white and black hairs. Stipules nearly free from petiole, at least those of lower leaves vaginate-connate behind stem. Racemes loose, more rarely dense, borne on well-developed peduncle. Calyx campanulate or shortly tubular-campanulate. Flowers mostly small. Petals purplish or violet, rarely white; standard often without distinct claw; wings as long as or mostly longer than keel, with obtuse to incised tip. Legumes sessile or shortly stipitate, narrowly oblong to narrowly ellipsoid, grooved dorsally, incompletely to completely 2-locular, more rarely 1-locular.
