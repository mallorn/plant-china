## Description
Plants evergreen. Rhizome erect or ascending, together with basal stipe densely scaly; scales dark brown, broadly lanceolate, thickly membranous, margins fimbriate, apices acuminate. Fronds 26-55 cm; stipe stramineous, 13-30 cm, 1.5-2 mm in diam. at middle, distal stipe scales smaller, brown, lanceolate or subulate, membranous, margins ciliate, apices caudate. Lamina 1-pinnate, grayish green or light green when dry, adaxially shiny, oblong, 13-25 × 6-10 cm at middle, not contracted toward base, base rounded, apex pinnatifid-acuminate; rachis stramineous, without proliferous bulbils, abaxially sparsely scaly; scales similar to distal stipe scales, brown, lanceolate to subulate, margins ciliate, apices filiform. Pinnae 4-8 pairs, alternate, approximate, ascendant, shortly stalked, narrowly elliptic, basal pairs 6-6.5 × 2-2.4 cm at middle, bases cuneate and nearly symmetrical, acroscopic base not auriculate, proximal acroscopic margins of pinnae slightly curved and forming a 0°-40° angle with rachis, acroscopic margins very slightly curved, regularly shallowly incised, basal basiscopic margins cuneate, forming a 80°-120° angle with rachis, entire, distal basiscopic margins curved upward, regularly shallowly incised-toothed, apices acuminate; adaxially glabrous, abaxially sparsely scaly; microscales light brown, filiform; frond texture thinly leathery; most veins free, distinct on both surfaces, with few or more obliquely rectangular areoles on each side of midrib, areoles not in a complete row, each areole with or without 1 included veinlet. Sori in 1 row on each side of midrib, terminal on free veinlets above acroscopic base of lateral veins, or on included veinlets, rarely on connections between veinlets, medial, lower part of lamina sometimes sterile; indusia present, brown, membranous, entire, evanescent.
