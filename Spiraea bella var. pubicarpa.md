6b.**Spiraea bella var. pubicarpa** T. T. Yu & L. T. Lu",

> One of us (Lu) believes that *Spiraea hemicryptophyta* Grierson (Notes Roy. Bot. Gard. Edinburgh 44: 262. 1987), described from China (SE Xizang, NW Yunnan), N Myanmar, Nepal, and Sikkim, may be synonymous with *S. bella* and that further study is necessary to determine its identity. The new species was said to differ from *S. bella* in having stems annual, rarely branched, 20--40 cm tall, and corymbs all terminal.

## Description
Follicles pubescent throughout.

> Mountain broad-leaved or coniferous forests; 2300--2600 m. S Xizang.
