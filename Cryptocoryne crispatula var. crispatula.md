Leaves upright to flat on soil surface, rather stiff (in shaded habitats more lax), mostly green but often brownish (to brown) with markings in sun-exposed habitats, lanceolate to strap-shaped, 10-30 × 0.5-1.5(-2.5) cm, smooth to somewhat finely undulate to crenulate along margin, entire or distinctly irregularly serrulate.

Spathe with a tube 10-20 cm; limb with a rather long, somewhat tight to open spiral, usually grayish, mostly with shorter or longer purplish markings of varying intensities, but also a completely white limb has been found. Fl. Nov-Apr. 2*n* = 36, 54.
