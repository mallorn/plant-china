Inflorescences axillary and infrequently apparently also terminal, 6-15 mm in diam., few to several flowered, notably hispidulous to pilosulous; bracts filiform, 0.5-4 mm.

This species is considered an invasive weed in the area of Guangzhou in Guangdong Province. W. C. Ko (in FRPS 71(2): 207. 1999) described the fruit as septicidal to base at maturity, septum not caducous, or septum of one valve caducous, but there seems to be a confusion here and this description is not accurate for this species.The seeds of this species were illustrated by Chaw and Sivarajan (Bot.
