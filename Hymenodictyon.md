## Description
Shrubs or trees [or sometimes epiphytic or lianescent], usually deciduous, unarmed; bark notably bitter. Raphides absent. Leaves opposite, usually with domatia; margins rarely irregularly lobed and/or serrate; stipules deciduous, interpetiolar, triangular to ligulate, entire or glandular-serrate, usually strongly reflexed. Inflorescence terminal and/or axillary, spiciform to racemiform or sometimes paniculate with axes racemiform or spiciform, many flowered, erect to pendulous, pedunculate, bracteate with 1-4 leaflike to petaloid, stipitate, veined basal bracts and other bracts usually reduced [or sometimes well developed]. Flowers sessile to shortly pedicellate, bisexual, monomorphic. Calyx limb deeply 5(or 6)-lobed. Corolla white, green, yellow, or red, funnelform or narrowly campanulate, inside glabrous; lobes 5, valvate in bud, apparently often ascending or remaining partially closed at anthesis. Stamens 5, inserted in corolla tube below throat, included; filaments short, flattened; anthers basifixed, sagittate at base. Ovary 2-celled, ovules several to numerous in each cell on axile placentas; stigma fusiform or capitate, well exserted. Infructescences with pedicels and sometimes peduncles often elongating and/or becoming reflexed. Fruit capsular, ellipsoid-oblong to obovoid or ellipsoid, loculicidally dehiscent into 2 valves, woody to cartilaginous, with calyx limb deciduous; seeds numerous, medium-sized, flattened, with broad, membranous, shortly erose, basally 2-lobed wing; endosperm fleshy; embryo small; cotyledon oblong or orbicular.
  "Reference": "The flowers apparently all open nearly simultaneously on a plant, probably within a very few days at most. The corolla lobes appear to remain partly closed when the flower is mature and the stigma well exserted; Razafimandimbison and Bremer (Bot. J. Linn. Soc. 152: 335. 2006) reported that the flowers are protandrous, so this may be a secondary position after the anthers have released their pollen and while the stigma is receptive. Occasional irregularly lobed leaves, similar to those of plants of *Hymenodictyon*, are found in a few other Rubiaceae genera (e.g., *Simira* Aublet of the Neotropics).The flowers apparently all open nearly simultaneously on a plant, probably within a very few days at most.
