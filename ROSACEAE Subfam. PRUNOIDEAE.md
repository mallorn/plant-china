**ROSACEAE Subfam. PRUNOIDEAE**",

> The genera *Amygdalus, Armeniaca, Cerasus, Laurocerasus, Padus*, and *Prunus* are often treated at the subgeneric or sectional level within the genus *Prunus*. *Pygeum* is usually treated as a distinct genus but has sometimes also been included within *Prunus*. The three cherry genera (*Cerasus, Laurocerasus*, and *Padus*) are probably more closely related to each other than they are to the other genera in the Prunoideae. Recent phylogenetic studies based on molecular data show that none of these three cherry genera are monophyletic, and their separation is probably not justified (Bortiri et al., Syst. Bot. 26: 797–807. 2001).
