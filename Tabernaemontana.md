Corolla salverform, widened at or near middle, lobes sharply overlapping to left [or right]. Stamens inserted in widened part of corolla tube; filaments short or almost none; anthers oblong or narrowly triangular, free from pistil head, base sagittate or deeply cordate and not spurred; disc absent. Ovaries 2, free; ovules numerous. Style filiform; pistil head with a subglobose or lampshade-shaped basal part and stigmoid, 2-cleft apical part. Follicles 2, divaricate.
