26.**POACEAE Tribe ERIACHNEAE**",

> This small tribe resembles *Isachneae* and *Paniceae* in its embryo structure and indurate lemmas with inrolled margins. However, the combination of bisexual florets, hairy, awned lemmas, and Kranz leaf anatomy distinguishes it from both.

## Description
Annuals or perennials. Leaf blades narrow; ligule a line of hairs. Inflorescence a terminal panicle. Spikelets all alike, slightly laterally compressed, florets 2 without a rachilla extension, disarticulating below each floret; glumes persistent, membranous to papery, of variable length, (1–)7–14-veined, acute to acuminate; florets similar, both fertile, dorsally compressed, narrowly elliptic; lemmas leathery to crustaceous or sometimes cartilaginous, (3–)5–9-veined, hairy, margins inrolled and clasping palea keels, apex entire, awnless or with a straight or curved awn. Caryopsis ellipsoid to linear. Leaf anatomy Kranz PS type; microhairs slender or stout. *x* = (9), 10, 12.
