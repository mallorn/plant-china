棱果沙棘",
5.**Hippophae goniocarpa** Y. S. Lian et al. ex Swenson & Bartish",

> Lian et al. (Proceedings of International Workshop on Seabuckthorn, 60-66. 1995) suggest that this taxon is of hybrid origin (*Hippophae neurocarpa* × *H. rhamnoides* subsp. *sinensis*) but it is uniform over a number of localities and produces fully fertile seeds, and thus merits treatment as a full species.
