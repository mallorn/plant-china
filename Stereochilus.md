## Description
Herbs, epiphytic, monopodial. Stems suberect, short or rather long, noded. Leaves several to many, distichous, flat, sometimes ± conduplicate, leathery, jointed, sessile, often sheathing at base. Inflorescence 1-3, axillary, racemose, lax, often pendulous, many flowered; floral bracts very small, much shorter than pedicel and ovary. Flowers small, often opening widely; lateral sepals adnate to base of lip. Petals smaller than sepals; lip adnate to column base, immovable, saccately spurred at base, indistinctly 3-lobed; lateral lobes erect, small; mid-lobe larger; spur with longitudinal septum inside and often 1 or 2 calli on back wall. Column rather stout, without a foot; rostellum subulate-lanceolate, rather long; pollinia 4, in 2 pairs, equal, ellipsoid-oblong to ovoid, waxy, with short but distinct caudicles, attached by a long, slender, somewhat clavate stipe to a small, ovate viscidium.
  "Reference": "A third, as yet undescribed, apparently endemic species has been identified from S Yunnan, where it seems to be rather more common than either *Stereochilus brevirachis* or *S. dalatensis* (Perner, pers. comm.). It has the short inflorescence of *S. brevirachis* but has flowers with pink lip lateral lobes and a glabrous pedicel and ovary.A third, as yet undescribed, apparently endemic species has been identified from S Yunnan, where it seems to be rather more common than either *Stereochilus brevirachis* or *S. dalatensis* (Perner, pers. comm.).
