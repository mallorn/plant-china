台湾银背藤",
21.**Argyreia formosana** Ishigami ex T. Yamazaki",

> &lt;I&gt;Argyreia formosana&lt;/I&gt; was not treated in Fl. Reipubl. Popularis Sin. and was considered a synonym of &lt;I&gt;A. obtusifolia&lt;/I&gt; Loureiro in the Flora of Taiwan (4: 348. 1978). Loureiro's name has been widely misapplied to various taxa in China and throughout southeast Asia, and the protologue is so vague that it is impossible to apply the name correctly. The Taiwanese specimens are quite distinct from all taxa called &lt;I&gt;A.&lt;/I&gt; &lt;I&gt;obtusifolia&lt;/I&gt; from mainland China and southeast Asia, and the prudent course seems to be to recognize them under Yamazaki's name until a careful study can be undertaken.
