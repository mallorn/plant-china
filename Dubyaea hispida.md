## Description
Herbs 20-60 cm tall, perennial, with creeping ?rhizomes. Stem erect, branched from below middle or higher up, leafy, with long blackish stiff glandular hairs and pale curly weak hairs. Basal and lower stem leaves sessile or base attenuate into a long petiole-like portion, oblanceolate, elliptic, or narrowly elliptic, 5-18 × 1.5-6 cm, sinuate-dentate to shallowly lyrately pinnatifid, both faces with hairs or mainly abaxially, base narrow to widened and ± clasping, margin mucronulately dentate, apex acute to acuminate. Middle and upper stem leaves similar to lower stem leaves but ± lanceolate, smaller, base auriculately clasping; uppermost stem leaves linear-lanceolate, reduced in size. Synflorescence corymbiform, with 2-7 capitula. Capitula nodding, with 40-50 florets; peduncle blackish pilose. Involucre campanulate, 1.8-2 × 1-1.5 cm. Phyllaries with long dark brown to blackish stiff glandular hairs on midvein except on innermost ones; outer phyllaries rather few, narrowly lanceolate to linear, closely approaching inner ones in length, apex acute to acuminate; inner phyllaries many, lanceolate, margin apically often ± brownish ciliate to fringed. Florets yellow. Achene brown, 7-9 mm, with several ribs, apex long attenuate and paler. Pappus yellowish, 0.8-1.2 cm. Fl. and fr. Jul-Nov. 2*n* = 16.

Yunnan. 13: 704. 2004), who consequently included also the segregates *D. lanceolata* and *D. pteropoda*, distinguished only by minor differences in leaf shape. The underground parts are usually described as creeping rhizomes from which the stems arise; no specimen, however, has been seen where a true rhizome is preserved. The underground parts preserved in the material seen could also be interpreted as root-borne shoots.*Dubyaea hispida* is here considered in the wider sense established by Stebbins (Mem. Torrey Bot.
