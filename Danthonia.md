扁芒草属",
119.**Danthonia** Candolle in Lamarck & Candolle",

> *Danthonia* had a much broader circumscription in the past, including many species now placed in *Rytidosperma*. Species of *Rytidosperma* lack cleistogenes, and also differ from the above description in having lemma hairs in tufts, ciliate lodicules, and a punctiform hilum. Modern molecular studies have shown these two genera belong to different evolutionary lines. It is likely that the Himalayan species will be shown to be members of *Rytidosperma*, but some morphological characters are intermediate and the species have not yet been included in any molecular analysis. Further research is required to clarify their position.

## Description
Perennial. Culms tufted, erect, cleistogenes often present in culm sheaths. Leaf blades narrow, flat or rolled; ligule a line of hairs. Inflorescence an open or contracted panicle, sometimes reduced to a raceme. Spikelets large, wedge-shaped, laterally compressed, florets several, rachilla disarticulating above glumes and between florets; glumes subequal, as long as spikelet, membranous or papery, (1–)3–9-veined; floret callus short, obtuse; lemmas herbaceous or papery, 7–9-veined, pilose on margins or all over, apex 2-lobed, lobes acute or extended into slender awns; central awn arising from sinus, flat, column short, strongly twisted, bristle straight or sparsely twisted; palea equal to or shorter than its lemma. Lodicules 2, glabrous. Caryopsis with linear hilum up to 2/3 its length.
