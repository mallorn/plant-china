22.**Digitaria fauriei** Ohwi",

> This species is reported in the literature to have paired spikelets, but in fact they are ternate and the hairs are verrucose with coiled tips, not capitate. The species is close to the widespread, weedy *Digitaria violascens*, but is remarkable for its very short upper glume, clearly exposing the purple upper floret, and its curling spikelet hairs.

## Description
Annual. Culms tufted, shortly stoloniferous at base, 15–20 cm tall, glabrous. Leaf sheaths subcompressed, glabrescent; leaf blades 3–5 × 0.2–0.4 cm, sparsely pilose; ligule ca. 0.4 mm, truncate. Inflorescence subdigitate; racemes 2–4, erect, slender, 3–5 cm; spikelets ternate; rachis winged, 0.8–1 mm broad, wing broader than midrib, margins scabrous. Spikelets oblong-elliptic, 1.3–1.5 mm, pale green, apex acute, hairs white becoming dirty yellow, verrucose, often with coiled tips; lower glume absent; upper glume 1/4–1/2 as long as spikelet; lower lemma elliptic, 5–7-veined, pilose, obtuse; upper lemma purplish black at maturity, elliptic-ovate, subequaling lower lemma.
