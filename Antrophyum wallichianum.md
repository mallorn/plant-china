8.**Antrophyum wallichianum** M. G. Gilbert & X. C. Zhang",

> *Antrophyum wallichianum* sometimes approaches the narrow-fronded forms of *A. callifolium*, except for the obvious stipes of the latter. Dried fronds are olive-green.Blume’s name, based on material from Mauritius, has been largely overlooked, hence the need for a new name. Wallich gave a clear reference to D. Don and thus his name was one of the few validated in his Numerical List. It seems appropriate to name the taxon in his honor.

## Description

Fronds clustered; stipe indistinct; lamina leathery, oblanceolate, 15-30 cm, ca. 2 cm wide at middle, widest above middle, up to 3 cm wide, apex rounded, base long attenuate to very base; costa only visible at base; veins abundantly reticulate, raised abaxially, forming several parallel lines, invisible adaxially. Soral lines continuous, rarely interrupted, parallel, not netted, only lower 1/3 fertile; paraphyses filiform, longer than sporangia. Spores trilete, tetrahedral-globose, surface papillate.
