## Description
Rhizomes short, plants densely tufted. Basal sheaths persistent, brown, dull, not retaining dried leaf blades. Culms stiffly erect, obtusely trigonous, very short, 9-16 cm tall, ca. 0.8 mm in diam. Leaves basal, ca. as long as culms; blade erect, filiform, ca. 0.5 mm wide, margin involute. Inflorescence a dense spike, brown, cylindric, 1-1.5 × 0.3-0.5 cm, androgynous; lowest involucral bract glumelike, apex shortly aristate; spikelets usually all unisexual, terminal few male, lower ones female (occasionally with a single reduced male flower within prophyll). Male glumes brown, with yellowish green midvein, lanceolate, ca. 3.5 × 1.5 mm, apex rounded. Female glumes brown, with yellowish green midvein, ovate or oblong-ovate, 3-3.5 × 1.8-2.5 mm, papery, midvein broad, margin very narrowly hyaline, apex rounded. Prophylls brown, oblong, 3-3.8 × 1.2-1.5 mm, membranous, 2-keeled, keels smooth, margins free to base. Nutlets brown to dark brown, shiny, oblong-elliptic, trigonous, 2.3-2.5 × 1.3-1.6 mm, not beaked, not stipitate. Stigmas 3.
