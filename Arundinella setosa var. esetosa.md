3b.**Arundinella setosa var. esetosa** Bor ex S. M. Phillips & S. L. Chen",

> This name was previously published by Bor (Grasses Burma, Ceylon, India, Pakistan, 425. 1960), but not validly so because no type was indicated.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Arundinella bidentata* and *A. macauensis* are both based on exceptionally hairy specimens densely hispid in all their parts. *Arundinella bidentata* has short, blunt apical lemma lobes lacking bristles, whereas in *A. macauensis* the lobes are tipped by very short bristles. *Arundinella hupeiensis* Keng &amp; X. P. Liou may also belong here, but it has not been possible to see the type (*L. Y. Tai &amp; C. H. Chien 465*, holotype, N; isotype, HIB).
