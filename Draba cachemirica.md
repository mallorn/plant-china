35.**Draba cachemirica** Gandoger",

> Although &lt;I&gt;Draba cachemirica&lt;/I&gt; was first recorded from Xizang by Schulz, that record was overlooked in FRPS and Fl. Xizang. (vol. 2. 1985). The occurrence of the species in Xizang is here confirmed based on Schlagintweit 2464 and 2410 (both mounted on one sheet at GH). Pohle (Repert. Spec. Nov. Regni Veg. Beih. 32: 135. 1925) recognized the latter gathering as the type collection of &lt;I&gt;D. korshinskyi&lt;/I&gt; var. &lt;I&gt;setosa&lt;/I&gt;, but &lt;I&gt;D. korshinskyi&lt;/I&gt; can easily be distinguished from &lt;I&gt;D. cachemirica&lt;/I&gt; by having leaves abaxially tomentose (vs. glabrous or rarely sparsely pubescent) with the margin non-setose and ciliate.

## Description
Herbs perennial, 1.5-10 cm tall, densely cespitose, scapose. Caudex many branched, ultimate branches terminated in rosettes and covered with papery leaf remains of previous years. Stems erect, slender, simple, glabrous throughout, sometimes sparsely pubescent with minute, forked or stellate trichomes. Basal leaves densely rosulate, persistent, sessile; leaf blade linear or linear-oblong, 2-7 × 0.5-1(-1.5) mm, abaxially sparsely pubescent with subsessile, forked or stellate trichomes, often glabrous on both surfaces, always ciliate with setose simple trichomes to 1 mm, base subobtuse, margin entire, apex obtuse to acute; midvein prominent abaxially almost to apex, narrower than blade on each side. Cauline leaves absent. Racemes 3-12(-20)-flowered, ebracteate, elongated slightly or considerably in fruit. Fruiting pedicels 1.5-8 mm, ascending, straight or slightly curved, glabrous or rarely sparsely pilose all around. Sepals oblong, 1.5-2.5 × 0.8-1.2 mm, erect, glabrous or abaxially pilose with simple and forked trichomes, base of lateral pair not saccate, margin narrowly membranous. Petals yellow, narrowly obovate, 3-4 × 1-2 mm, apex emarginate. Filaments 1.5-2.5 mm; anthers ovate, 0.3-0.4 mm. Ovules 4-8 per ovary. Fruit ovoid to subglobose, 2.5-4.5 × 2-3.5 mm, inflated, not twisted; valves glabrous or rarely puberulent, obscurely veined, base semicordate, apex acute; style 0.2-0.4 mm. Seeds brown, ovate, 1-1.2 × 0.5-0.6 mm. Fl. Jun-Jul, fr. Jul-Aug.
