## Description
Annual or perennial herbs. Leaf blades linear to ovate; ligule a short membrane with ciliate or ciliolate margin. Inflorescence composed of racemes; racemes solitary, digitate or scattered along an axis, tough, unilateral (bilateral and axis fragile in *Lepturus*), persistent, or sometimes racemes very short, contracted into a cylindrical spikelike inflorescence and falling entire from main axis, or spikelets borne directly on main axis. Spikelets with 1 fertile floret, with or without additional sterile florets, disarticulating above glumes but not between florets or falling entire; glumes herbaceous, 1–3-veined (5–12-veined in *Lepturus*), shorter than floret or exceeding and enclosing it, sometimes lower glume absent; lemma membranous to leathery, keeled or rounded, 1–3-veined, lateral veins near margins and often ciliate, apex entire or 2–3(–5)-lobed, awned or awnless. Caryopsis sometimes with free pericarp. Leaf anatomy: Kranz PS type; microhairs short and stout. *x* = 9, 10.
  "Statistics": "About 60 genera: throughout the tropics and subtropics, extending into North America; 12 genera (three introduced) and 27 species (six introduced) in China.
