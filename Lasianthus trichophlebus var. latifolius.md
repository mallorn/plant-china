31a.**Lasianthus trichophlebus var. latifolius** (Miquel) H. Zhu Syst. & Geogr. Pl. 72: 93. 2002.",

## Description
Branches densely hirsute. Leaves pubescent abaxially.
  "Reference": "This taxon was treated as *Lasianthus tomentosus* Blume by King and Gamble (J. Asiat. Soc. Bengal, Pt. 2, Nat. Hist. 73: 130. 1904), Ridley (Fl. Malay Penin. 2: 161. 1923), Craib (Fl. Siam. 2(2): 219. 1934), and H. Zhu (Acta Bot. Yunnan. 20: 155. 1998), which may be due to the authors following two misidentified sheets in K. These two specimens, which are labeled as *Horsfield s.n.* [Rub. 50] from Java, are indicated as \"*L. tomentosus* Blume\" with Miquel’s handwriting and also were cited as such in print (Miquel, Fl. Ned. Ind. 2: 318. 1857). Miquel (loc. cit. 1869) later changed his mind and considered that they were not the same as *L. tomentosus*. The type materials of *L. tomentosus* are only in Leiden and there are no overseas duplicates. After examining Malesian specimens and carefully comparing with the type of *L. tomentosus*, it is recognized that the taxon that was mistaken for *L. tomentosus* has conspicuous, strigose, linear-lanceolate stipules, 4-merous flowers, hirsute and verrucose drupes with 4 pyrenes, and is more closely related to *L. trichophlebus* than *L. tomentosus*. The taxon differs from *L. trichophlebus* by having only dense hirsute hairs on the branches and pubescent hairs on the abaxial leaf surface. It is better, therefore, to treat this taxon as a variety of *L. trichophlebus*.This taxon was treated as *Lasianthus tomentosus* Blume by King and Gamble (J. Asiat. Soc. Bengal, Pt. 2, Nat.
