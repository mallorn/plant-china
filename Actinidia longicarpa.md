长果猕猴桃",
51.**Actinidia longicarpa** R. G. Li & M. Y. Liang",

> Introduced from Longsheng or Ziyuan Xian in 1981, this species is cultivated in the research orchard of the Guangxi Institute of Botany, Guilin. The name was not validly published by Li and Liang in 2003 because no type was indicated (*Vienna Code*, Art. 37.1). *\"Actinidia rubrafilmenta\"* [sic] (R. G. Li &amp; J. W. Li, Guihaia 23: 199. 2003) also belongs here but was not validly published for the same reason.
