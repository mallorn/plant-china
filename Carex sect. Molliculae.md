## Description
Rhizome stoloniferous. Involucral bracts not sheathed or shortly sheathed. Spikes usually unisexual, terminal spike male, lateral spikes female (*Carex harrysmithii* and *C. agglomerata* with unisexual spikes and bisexual spikes), cylindric, rarely oblong, densely many flowered. Female glumes ovate or lanceolate-oblong, apex acuminate, mucronate, aristate, or muticous. Utricles yellowish green or stramineous, erect or obliquely patent, ovate, elliptic, or oblong, slightly inflated or inflated trigonous, many veined, beak medium sized to long or rather long, orifice shortly 2-toothed, rarely obliquely truncate or emarginate. Nutlets rather loosely enveloped; stigmas 3.
