115.**Salix pilosomicrophylla** C. Wang & P. Y. Fu",

> Similar to &lt;I&gt;Salix ovatomicrophylla&lt;/I&gt; but leaf blade larger, glaucous and sericeous abaxially; catkins numerous flowered; bracts pilose abaxially and at margin; filaments pilose. In the protologue, the specific epithet was spelt &lt;I&gt;&amp;quot;pilosomicrophylla&amp;quot;&lt;/I&gt; whereas, in FRPS, it was changed to &lt;I&gt;&amp;quot;trichomicrophylla&amp;quot;&lt;/I&gt; with an indication that the former was an error (Greek and Latin words are combined in the epithet, which might be considered linguistically unacceptable). However, there is no mechanism within the ICBN for allowing such a change.
