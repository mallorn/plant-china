22.**Rhododendron yaogangxianense** Q. X. Liu",

> The original author compared this species with *Rhododendron* yizhangense, pointing out that it differed in having a leaf blade abaxially with a raised midrib and densely hairy surface, calyx lobes pubescent above, and in features of the capsule. The raised midrib on the abaxial surface of the leaf blade suggests an affinity with *R*. *levinei*, but the two species are otherwise perfectly distinct. The present authors have seen no material of this species and so cannot confirm its true affinities.
