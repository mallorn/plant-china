## Description
Shrubs, subshrubs, or herbs. Stems with or without resin ducts, without fibers in phloem. Leaves alternate or rarely subopposite, often glandular, petiolate or sessile, margins entire or dentate to serrate, sometimes pinnatifid to pinnatisect. Capitula usually in corymbiform, paniculiform, or racemiform arrays, often solitary or few together, heterogamous or less often homogamous. Phyllaries persistent or falling, in (2 or)3-7+ series, distinct, unequal to subequal, herbaceous to membranous, margins and/or apices usually scarious; stereome undivided. Receptacles flat to somewhat convex, epaleate or paleate. Capitula radiate, disciform, or discoid. Marginal florets when present radiate, miniradiate, or filiform, in 1 or 2, or sometimes several series, female and fertile; corollas usually yellow, sometimes reddish, rarely ochroleucous or purple. Disk florets bisexual or functionally male, fertile; corollas usually yellow, sometimes reddish, rarely ochroleucous or purplish, actinomorphic, not 2-lipped, lobes (4 or)5, usually ± deltate; anther bases tailed, apical appendages ovate to lanceolate-ovate or linear, rarely truncate; styles abaxially with acute to obtuse hairs, distally or reaching below bifurcation, branches ± linear, adaxially stigmatic in 2 lines from bases to apices (lines confluent distally), apices rounded to truncate, sterile apical appendage absent. Anthers with radial or polarized endothecial tissue. Achenes usually monomorphic within capitula, usually ellipsoid or columnar to prismatic, rarely with short beak, but sometimes abruptly constricted distally, often ribbed, glabrous or hairy, often glandular, hairs not myxogenic; pappus persistent, of ± barbellate bristles, of bristles and short scales, of short scales only, or rarely missing.
