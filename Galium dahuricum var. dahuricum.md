  "Reference": "This variety was listed as *Galium niewerthii* for the *Flora of Japan* (Yamazaki, loc. cit.: 238). Forms with many-flowered inflorescences, somewhat shorter pedicels, and glabrous ovaries and fruit have been seen from Yunnan; they apparently tend toward *G. asperifolium* and/or *G. prattii*. *Galium taiwanense* (see there) is very close to *G. dahuricum* var. *dahuricum* and evidently replaces it on Taiwan.This variety was listed as *Galium niewerthii* for the *Flora of Japan* (Yamazaki, loc. cit.: 238).
