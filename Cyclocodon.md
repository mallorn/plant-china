Flowers solitary, terminal or axillary, or in dichasium, perfect; bracteoles present, filiform or leaflike, or absent. Calyx partly adnate to or completely free from ovary, and thus epigynous or hypogynous for ovary; lobes 4-6, from subentire to branched. Corolla epigynous, tubular, 4-6-merous. Stamens 4-6; filaments dilated below, glabrous or ciliate at dilated part. Ovary inferior for corolla but from semi-inferior to superior for calyx, 3-6-locular; stigma 4-6-fid; ovules extremely numerous. Fruit a berry. Seeds extremely numerous, subglobose.
