宽萼金丝桃
26.**Hypericum latisepalum** (N. Robson) N. Robson

> *Hypericum latisepalum* is closely related (?ancestral) to *H. bellum* but is morphologically distinct. It has a more southerly distribution, mainly S of the Himalayan range except for its incursion into Xizang. Some populations approach the northern form of *H. beanii* closely in morphology but can be distinguished by the ovoid rather than pyramidal-ovoid ovary and the more deeply cupped flowers.


## Description
Shrubs, to 1.5 m tall, bushy; branches erect. Stems 4-angled and slightly ancipitous when young, very soon terete; internodes 1.5-6(-9) cm, shorter than to exceeding leaves. Leaves with petiole 1.5-3 mm; blade lanceolate or oblong-lanceolate to ± broadly ovate or triangular-ovate (l:w = 1.8-2.5), (3-)3.7-6.7(-8.7) × (1.3-)1.6-4.6 cm, thickly papery, abaxially paler or glaucous; laminar glands dots and short streaks; abaxial glands absent; main lateral veins 3- or 4-paired, tertiary reticulation lax or not visible; base cuneate to rounded, margin plane, apex acute (when young) or obtuse to rounded. Inflorescence 1-14-flowered, from apical node, nearly flat-topped, rarely with flowering branches from lower nodes; bracts narrowly elliptic or leaflike, persistent. Pedicels 3-14 mm (to 3 cm in fruit). Flowers 4-6 cm in diam., cupped; buds broadly ovoid, apex acute to obtuse. Sepals erect, subequal, ovate to broadly elliptic, 0.8-1.3 cm × (5-)6-8 mm, laminar glands lines, margin entire, apex obtuse or apiculate-obtuse to rounded. Petals golden yellow, broadly obovate, 2.3-3.7 × 1.8-3 cm, ca. 3 × as long as sepals, eglandular, margin entire, apiculus rounded. Stamen fascicles each with 45-55 stamens, longest (1-)1.4-2.1 cm, (0.5-)0.6-0.7 × as long as petals. Ovary broadly ovoid, 7-8 × 6-7 mm; styles (5-)6-7 mm, 0.75-1(-1.1) × as long as ovary, free, suberect, outcurved near apex. Capsule broadly ovoid, 1.2-1.5 × 1-1.5 cm. Seeds dark reddish brown, ca. 1.2 mm, carinate or nearly not; testa scalariform-reticulate. Fl. Jun-Oct, fr. (?Aug-)Sep-Nov.


> Open forests, forest edges, thickets, grassy slopes; 2500-2900(-3700) m. SE Xizang (Zayü), NW and W Yunnan [NE India, N Myanmar].
