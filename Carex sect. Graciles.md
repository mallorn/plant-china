Spikes few to numerous, single or several fasciculate in an involucral bract sheath or arranged in a raceme or panicle, usually bisexual, rarely unisexual or bisexual and unisexual, bisexual spikes androgynous, laxly or densely many flowered, rarely few flowered; peduncle slender. Utricles lenticular or plano-convex, several veined, base stipitate, beak orifice shortly 2-toothed.
