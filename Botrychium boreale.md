> According to reviewer Don Farrar, North American authors recognize three species from within the original concept of *Botrychium boreale*: *B. boreale* s.s. in Europe and *B. pinnatum* H. St. John and *B. alaskense* W. H. Wagner &amp; J. R. Grant in North America, including Alaska and the Aleutian Islands. The correct placement of Asian material has not yet been critically examined but could prove to belong to one or other of the American species rather than *B. boreale* s.s.
