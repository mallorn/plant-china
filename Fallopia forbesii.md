> The major characteristics that distinguish *Fallopia* *forbesii* from other, related species are the following: leaves orbicular to suborbicular, short, rounded at base, abruptly acuminate to cuspidate at apex; achenes relatively large (3.9–4.8 × 2.1–2.9 mm); perianth wings narrowly tapering to the articulated pedicel joint in fruit.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of us (Li) believes that *Fallopia* *forbesii* is conspecific with *Reynoutria* *japonica* (see Lauener, Notes Roy. Bot. Gard. Edinburgh 40: 202. 1982).

## Description
Herbs perennial, 1-2.5 m tall. Rhizomes well-developed, thick, ca. 1.6 cm in diam., lignified. Stems erect, robust, mostly branched above middle, 0.6-2.1 cm in diam., sparsely pubescent with conic unicellular trichomes, rarely together with 1-4-celled filiform trichomes. Leaves alternate; petiole 0.5-1.8 cm, circular in cross section, with extrafloral nectaries abaxially; ocrea completely surrounding stem, brown, cylindric, 0.5-1.5 cm, scarious, sparsely pubescent with conic unicellular trichomes, peltate multicellular glandular trichomes and 1-4-celled filiform trichomes, apex truncate; leaf blade orbicular to nearly so, 6.6-11.5 × 5.1-9.4 cm, both surfaces sparsely pubescent with peltate multicellular glandular trichomes, mid-vein and main veins sparsely pubescent with cornical unicellular trichomes, base rounded, margin entire, apex abruptly acuminate to cuspidate. Inflorescence terminal or axillary, simple or branched, 2-6.2 cm, pubescent with conic unicellular trichomes, 1-4-celled filiform trichomes and peltate multicellular glandular trichomes, panicle-like, consisting of a series of fascicles of 2-6 spirally arranged pedicellate flowers; each flower fascicle subtended by a bract (ocreola); bracts funnelform, 1.2-1.9 × 1-2 mm, scarious. Flowers functionally unisexual, rarely bisexual, 0.4-1.1 mm, each with bracteoles; bracteoles paired, scarious, fused at base; pedicels 2-3 mm, jointed above middle. Perianth petaloid, white to greenish white, 5-cleft; tepals 5, 3 outer ones keeled, 1.5-2.5 × 1-1.9 mm, with wings developed along main vascular bundle, wings ca. 0.2 wide. Stamens 8, inserted at base of perianth in 2 whorls, outer stamens 3-3.4 mm, inner stamens 3.6-4 mm. Style 1, 0.3-0.5 mm, deeply 3-cleft; stigmas fimbriate. Achenes enclosed in persistent perianth, dark brown, shiny, trigonous, obovate to orbicular, 3.9-4.8 × 2.1-2.9 mm, smooth; perianth wings narrowly tapering to articulated pedicel-joint in fruit. 2n = 66, 88.
