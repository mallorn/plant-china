10.**Drypetes longistipitata** P. T. Li",

> *Drypetes longistipitata* is most closely related to *D. hainanensis* and *D. rhakodiskos* (Hasskarl) Bakhuizen f. in habit. It differs by the delicate, longer fruiting pedicels, fewer lateral veins, and smaller fruits.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This taxon was first published as *\"Drypetes hainanensis* var. *longistipitata\"* (P. T. Li, Acta Phytotax. Sin 26(1): 58. 1988), but that name was not validly published as two types were cited.
