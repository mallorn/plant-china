3.**Pollia macrobracteata** D. Y. Hong",

> &lt;I&gt; Pollia macrobracteata&lt;/I&gt; is related to &lt;I&gt; P. hasskarlii&lt;/I&gt; and &lt;I&gt; P. japonica,&lt;/I&gt; and all have 6 fertile stamens. It differs from &lt;I&gt; P. japonica&lt;/I&gt; in having inflorescence and peduncle much shorter, and involucral bracts ovate, larger, and apically broadly acute; from &lt;I&gt; P. hasskarlii &lt;/I&gt;in having involucral bracts larger and herbaceous, cincinni, peduncle, and pedicels longer, and roots that arise from stem nodes thicker; and from both species in having much smaller leaves with shorter leaf sheaths.
