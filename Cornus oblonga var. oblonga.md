> *Yinquania* *muchuanesis* is restricted to S Sichuan (Muchuan). It was recognized on the basis of its smaller size (2–4 m tall) and subglobose fruit; *C*. *oblonga* is typically a tree 2–16 m tall, with ellipsoid or subglobose fruit. Given that *Y*. *muchuanesis* falls within the size range of *C*. *oblonga* and subglobose fruit are also found in *C*. *oblonga*, *Y*. *muchuanesis* is tentatively treated here as a synonym of *C*. *oblonga*. Further evidence is needed to determine the status of this species.
