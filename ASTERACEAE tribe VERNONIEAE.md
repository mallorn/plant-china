## Description
Herbs, shrubs, sometimes climbing, or trees; hairs simple, T-shaped, or stellate. Leaves usually alternate [rarely opposite or whorled], leaf blade entire or serrate-dentate [rarely pinnately divided], venation pinnate, rarely with 3 basal veins (*Distephanus*). Synflorescences mostly terminal, less often terminal on short lateral branches or axillary, mostly cymose paniculate, less often spikelike, forming globose compound heads or reduced to a solitary capitulum. Capitula discoid, homogamous. Phyllaries generally imbricate, in several rows, rarely in 2 rows, herbaceous, scarious or leathery, outer gradually shorter. Receptacle flat or rather convex, naked or ± fimbriate. Florets 1-400, all bisexual, fertile; corolla tubular, purple, reddish purple, pink, or white, rarely yellow (*Distephanus*), limb narrowly campanulate or funnelform, 5-lobed. Anther base bifid, auriculate, acute or hastate, rarely caudate, apex appendaged. Style branches usually long and slender, apex subulate or acute, dorsally pilose, without appendage. Achenes cylindric or slightly flattened, (2-)5-10[-20]-ribbed, or 4- or 5-angled, rarely ± terete; pappus usually present, persistent, of many filiform setae, bristles, or scales, often 2-seriate with inner series of setae or bristles and shorter outer series of scales, sometimes very few and deciduous (*Camchaya*) or absent (*Ethulia*).
