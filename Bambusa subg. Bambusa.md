簕竹亚属",
1.**Bambusa subg. Bambusa**",

## Description
Culm internodes mostly shorter than 30 cm; wall to 2 cm thick; branches usually arising from basal, mid-culm, and apical nodes, usually 3 co-dominant; branchlets of lower branches specialized into tough or weak thorns. Culm sheaths thickly leathery; auricles large, rounded or irregular, or absent; blade persistent, broad, base 1/2–3/4 width of sheath apex. Pseudospikelets loose at maturity, with broad florets on short rachilla segments.
  "Statistics": "More than 35 species: widely distributed in tropical and subtropical Asia; widely planted in other parts of the world; 27 species (24 endemic) in China, mainly in the south, some in the southwest.
