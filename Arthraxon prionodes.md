2.**Arthraxon prionodes** (Steudel) Dandy",

> *Arthraxon prionodes* has often been confused with *A. lanceolatus* (Roxburgh) Hochstetter, from the hills of S India. The latter species differs in its slightly broader, linear-lanceolate sessile glume with a flat back between the tuberculate lateral keels and obvious, raised intercarinal veins clearly visible from the glume base upward.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Occasionally the sessile glume is shortly pubescent, and the name *Arthraxon pilophorus* is based on such a plant. The name *A. lanceolatus* var. *raizadae* (Jain et al.) Welzen has been misapplied in China to this variant. It correctly applies to a low annual from peninsular India with long (6–7 mm), velutinous sessile spikelets.

## Description
Perennial, loosely tufted, base knotty, covered in silky-tomentose scales. Culms stiff, erect or straggling, 40–60 cm long. Leaf sheaths glabrous or tuberculate-hispid; leaf blades lanceolate to narrowly ovate, tough, glaucous, 2–7 cm × 5–15 mm, usually glabrous, base rounded, margins cartilaginous and pectinate-setose from stout tubercles, apex setaceously acuminate; ligule 0.5–1 mm. Racemes 2–11, 2–7 cm, pale green or tinged purple, suberect; rachis internodes 1/3–2/3 length of sessile spikelets, pilose, hairs increasing to 2–3 mm at apex. Sessile spikelet 5.8–7.2 mm; lower glume linear, strongly convex, laterally keeled, margins inflexed, back obscurely veined below middle, glabrous or puberulous, rarely shortly pubescent, 5 scaberulous veins between keels toward apex, keels stoutly tuberculate-spinose, a second row of smaller tubercles on inner side of keels; upper lemma subentire to shortly denticulate, teeth 0.1–0.4 mm; awn 10–15 mm; palea absent. Anthers 3, 2.4–3.8 mm. Pedicelled spikelet narrowly lanceolate, 4–5 mm, staminate. Fl. and fr. Jul–Oct. 2*n* = 16, 36.
