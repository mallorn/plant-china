> Although FRPS (6(1): 183. 1999) and Fl. Taiwan (ed. 2, 1: 188. 1994) recognized *Davallia formosana* as a separate species, the type of *D. formosana* fits well within the variability of *D. divaricata*.

## Description
Rhizome 10-15 mm in diam. (without scales), not white waxy. Scales brown or red-brown without pale border, narrowed evenly toward apex, curling backward or not, basifixed with cordate base and much overlapping lobes, 5-20 × 2-4 mm, without multiseptate hairs, toothed. Stipe pale, adaxially grooved, 15-60 cm, glabrous or with few scales; lamina compound, tripinnate toward base and in middle part, deltoid and broadest toward base, 55-100 × 40-90 cm, glabrous, not or slightly dimorphic. Longest petiolules 4-35 mm; pinnae deltoid; longest pinnae 8-45 × 5-30 cm; pinnules of at least larger pinnae anadromous, deltoid; longest pinnules 70-200 × 40-110 mm; ultimate pinnae linear-oblong or narrowly ovate, lobed halfway toward midrib or only shallowly lobed; ultimate segments 5-27 × 2-6 mm. Rachis adaxially distinctly grooved (often with a groove at either side). Rachises and costae glabrous. Margins of each pinna not thickened. Veins in sterile ultimate lobes pinnate (or forked in very narrow lobes), reaching margin; false veins absent. Sori separate, borne several on a segment, at forking point of veins; indusium also attached along sides, pouch-shaped, oblong, ± as wide as long, ca. 1 × 1 mm, upper margin not elongated, truncate or slightly rounded, separated from or even with lamina margin; lamina generally extending into a tooth at both sides of a sorus.

> Generally epiphytic, sometimes epilithic on limestone, rarely terrestrial, mostly in dense forests, sometimes on dry places; sea level to 1900 m.
