5.**Cymbopogon liangshanensis** L. Liu ex S. M. Phillips & H. Peng",

> This species resembles *Andropogon* in its non-deflexing racemes and the lack of an obvious homogamous spikelet pair, although this is usually present as a vestige. It is not known whether the leaves are aromatic. The enlarged, toothed, cupular tips to the raceme bases, raceme internodes, and pedicels are a distinctive character of this species.
