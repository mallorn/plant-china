24.**POACEAE Tribe PANICEAE**",

> The *Paniceae* are a distinctive tribe on account of the uniform pattern of deciduous, 2-flowered spikelets with a staminate or barren lower floret and an indurated, fertile upper floret enclosing the caryopsis.

## Description
Perennial or annual. Leaf blades usually linear or lanceolate; ligule membranous, a line of hairs, or a short membrane with ciliate fringe (rarely absent in some *Echinochloa*). Inflorescence variable, an open to spikelike panicle or composed of unilateral racemes, these digitate or spread along a cental axis; spikelets single, paired or clustered, sometimes supported by spines or bristles. Spikelets all alike (sexes separate in *Spinifex* and *Thuarea*), florets 2, without a rachilla extension, lower floret staminate or barren, upper floret bisexual, spikelets dorsally or infrequently lightly laterally compressed, falling entire, usually awnless; glumes membranous or herbaceous, lower glume usually shorter than the spikelet and sometimes very small or rudimentary, upper glume often as long as the spikelet; lower lemma usually as long as the spikelet and resembling the upper glume, with or without a palea; upper floret commonly indurated, tightly enclosing the caryopsis, lemma margins narrow and inrolled or broad and hyaline. Caryopsis with a large embryo 1/3–1/2 its length, hilum punctiform (rarely linear in *Acroceras*, *Oplismenus*, and some *Panicum*). Leaf anatomy: mixed, including non-Kranz, Kranz MS, and Kranz PS types. *x* = 9, occasionally 10 (rarely other numbers reported).
