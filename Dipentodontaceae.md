> Both *Dipentodon* and *Perrottetia* have often been treated in the Celastraceae. However, both morphological and molecular evidence indicate that they are better treated in the family Dipentodontaceae (Zhang &amp; Simmons, Syst. Bot. 31: 122-137. 2006).&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheng Chingyung. 1999. *Dipentodon*. *In:* Cheng Chingyung &amp; Huang Puhua, eds., Fl. Reipubl.
