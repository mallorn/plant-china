## Description
Shrubs to small trees, unarmed. Raphides presumably absent. Leaves opposite, apparently without domatia or these infrequent and rudimentary; stipules persistent at least near stem apex, interpetiolar, generally triangular, 2-lobed. Inflorescences terminal and sometimes also in uppermost leaf axils and appearing sessile and tripartite, cymose with higher order axes often scorpioid, many flowered, pedunculate, bracteate with bracts persistent or caducous. Flowers sessile or subsessile, bisexual, distylous. Calyx limb deeply 5-lobed, on 1 or several flowers of an inflorescence with 1 white, elliptic or ovate calycophyll. Corolla orange-yellow to orange, salverform with tube slender then abruptly swollen in upper part, inside pubescent at least in throat; lobes 5, notably acuminate, in bud valvate-induplicate with tips pressed together and ascending. Stamens 5, inserted in upper part of corolla tube, included in long-styled form, partially exserted in short-styled form; filaments short; anthers apparently basifixed. Ovary 2-celled, ovules numerous in each cell on axile peltate placentas; stigmas 2, linear, exserted in long-styled form or included in short-styled form. Fruit capsular, ellipsoid to obovoid, slightly flattened perpendicular to septum, loculicidally dehiscent through apical half, woody, with calyx limb persistent, with calycophylls persistent; seeds numerous, small, angled.
  "Reference": "This species was long included in *Mussaenda*, but morphological and molecular studies support its separation from that genus. Its morphology was studied by Puff et al. (Bull. Jard. Bot. Natl. Belg. 62: 35-68. 1993). Its lack of raphides has not been described but is presumed based on the classification of this genus by various authors in Isertieae.This species was long included in *Mussaenda*, but morphological and molecular studies support its separation from that genus.

灌木；枝方柱形，有稀疏的皮孔。叶对生，薄纸质，椭圆状长圆形或倒披针形，叶柄有纵槽；托叶披针形，顶端尾状，全缘，宿存或早落。聚伞花序顶生，末回分枝穗形蝎尾状，直立；苞片和小苞片线状披针形，宿存或脱落。花无梗或近无梗；花萼管长陀螺形，萼裂片5枚，披针状长圆形，有时有一枚萼裂片扩大为椭圆形或卵形的花叶；花冠高脚碟状，花冠管下部管状，上部突然膨大，花冠裂片5枚，三角状卵形，内向镊合状排列；雄蕊5枚，着生于花冠管上，花丝短，花药长；花盘环状；花柱丝状，柱头2，线形，子房2室，胎座盾状，肉质；胚珠多数。蒴果棕黑色，陀螺形或长圆状，倒卵形，顶部室间开裂；种子小，多数。
<p style='text-indent:28px'>本属为单种属。
<p style='text-indent:28px'>本属除果为室背开裂的蒴果外，与玉叶金花属 Mussaenda 几无区别，二者间无疑有极密切的亲缘关系。C. Puff et al. (Bull. Jard. Bot. Nat. Belg.) 62: 35-67. 1993认为本属与 Psudomussaenda 都是从玉叶金花属分化出来的。C. Tange (Nord. Journ. Bot. 14: 500. 1994) 除同意上述观点外，明确提出 Mussaenda. Neomussaenda. Schizomussaenda 和 Psudomussaenda 这4个属在 Isertieae 族中构成关系密切的一个属群。编者同意上述论点。
