Inflorescences terminal, corymbose to paniculiform, many flowered, pedunculate, bracteate with bracts reduced. Flowers pedicellate, bisexual, monomorphic, fragrant. Calyx limb 5-lobed nearly to base, with lobes imbricate in bud, some flowers of most inflorescences with 1 lobe expanded into a white petaloid calycophyll. Corolla white or yellow, funnelform with tube notably narrowed near base, glabrous inside; lobes 5, imbricate in bud. Stamens 5, inserted below corolla throat, included; filaments developed, tomentose; anthers dorsifixed, included. Ovary 2-celled, ovules numerous in each cell on peltate axile placentas; stigma capitate or shallowly 2-lobed, included. Fruit capsular, oblong-cylindrical to fusiform with disk portion shortly prolonged into a rounded beak, septicidally dehiscent from apex in apical half, woody, with calyx limb deciduous except with calycophyll sometimes persistent; seeds numerous, medium-sized, fusiform, flattened, winged; testa spongy, reticulate-areolate; albumen rich; embryo minute; cotyledons cylindric.
