Uppermost leaf sheaths smooth, closed for ca. 1/4 length; blade flat or folded, papery to thickly papery; ligule membranous. Panicle open or somewhat contracted; branches smooth or scabrid; spikelets compact; vivipary present (frequent in *P.* sect. *Arenariae*) or absent; glumes usually 3-veined. Anthers 0.2–2 mm.
