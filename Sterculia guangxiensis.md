26.**Sterculia guangxiensis** S. J. Xu & P. T. Li",

> *Sterculia guangxiensis* was compared in the protologue to *S. lanceolata* Cavanilles, but the petiole of the former is distinctly pulvinate at both ends, suggesting a closer relationship to *S. lanceifolia*, which differs by the longer (2.5-3.5 cm) petiole and rounded, not cuneate, base of the leaf blade.
