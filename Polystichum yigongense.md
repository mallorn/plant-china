> *Polystichum yigongense*, which was not recognized in FRPS (5(2): 49. 2001), is distinguished by its rhombic pinnules with short, sharp teeth as opposed to the nearly elliptic pinnules with long, sharp teeth in *P. neolobatum*. The two species have remarkably different spore sculptures.*Polystichum yigongense* was treated as a synonym of *P. makinoi* (Indian Fern. J. 2: 9. 1985) and *P. neolobatum* (Himalayan Ferns (Guide to *Polystichum*), 27. 1997) by Fraser-Jenkins.
