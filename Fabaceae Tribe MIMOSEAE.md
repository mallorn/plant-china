## Description
Leaves bipinnate. Flowers bisexual, polygamous, or andromonoecious (then upper flowers perfect, lower staminate or sterile), numerous in heads, spikes, or racemes, sometimes aggregated into compound inflorescences. Sepals usually 5, valvate or imbricate. Petals as many as sepals, valvate (except *Dinizia*), free to joined. Stamens usually 5-10, exserted, free or ± connate at base, sometimes petaloid in sterile flowers; anthers generally dorsifixed, with or without an apical gland; pollen simple or compound. Ovary sessile to stipitate; ovules 2 to many. Legumes usually compressed, occasionally terete, torulose, spirally twisted, or tetragonal and rarely winged, often curved, indehiscent or dehiscent along one or both margins, sometimes with valves separating from a persistent margin (replum) and breaking into 1-seeded segments. Seeds compressed, sometimes winged, exarillate, usually with a pleurogram.
