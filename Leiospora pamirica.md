> The protologue of &lt;I&gt;Parrya pamirica&lt;/I&gt; indicated that the species occurs in China, but no specimens were cited. In fact, Chinese plants have been repeatedly misidentified as &lt;I&gt;L. exscapa&lt;/I&gt; (see below), both in Chinese herbaria and in the account in FRPS (as &lt;I&gt;Parrya exscapa&lt;/I&gt;). &lt;I&gt;Leiospora pamirica&lt;/I&gt; is highly variable in the density of its indumentum; in very sparsely pubescent plants, branched trichomes can still be found along the leaf margin.

## Description
Plants 5-10(-15) cm tall, densely cespitose; caudex branched, densely covered with petiolar remains of previous years. Petiole broadened at base, ciliate, (0.5-)1-3(-4.2) cm; leaf blade spatulate or oblanceolate, rarely obovate, elliptic, or oblong, (0.7-)1-4(-5) cm × (3-)4-10(-15) mm, sparsely to densely pubescent with simple and short-stalked, forked trichomes, base cuneate or attenuate, margin entire or rarely few toothed, apex subacute to rounded. Flowers 2-7 per rosette, on solitary pedicels from center of rosette. Fruiting pedicels erect-ascending, glabrous, (1-)2-6(-7) cm. Sepals oblong, 6-10 × 1.5-2 mm, glabrous or sparsely pubescent, white margined. Petals obovate, (1.3-)1.5-2.2(-2.6) cm × (4-)6-8(-9) mm, apex rounded; claw (6-)8-11 mm. Filaments white, median pairs (4.5-)6-8 mm, lateral pair (2.5-)4-6 mm; anthers linear, 2.5-3 mm. Ovules 24-40 per ovary. Fruit linear to linear-lanceolate, (2.5-)3.5-7(-9) cm × 3-6(-7) mm, margin straight or undulate. Seeds orbicular, (2.5-)3-4 mm in diam., uni- or biseriate, flattened, broadly winged; wing undulate, 0.5-1 mm wide. Fl. and Fr. Jul-Sep.

> Dry stony plains, rocky cliffs; 3900-5500 m. Xinjiang, Xizang [Kashmir, Tajikistan].
