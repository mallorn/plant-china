> Two of us (Pimenov and Kljuykov) note that this taxon was originally projected for description by H. Wolff under the manuscript name “*Seseli* *plantagineum*” (herbarium P), and that specific status is preferable as, in nature, there are no mixed populations of this and the typical variety.&#x0D;\n&lt;p&gt;&#x0D;\nTwo of us (Pimenov &amp; Kljuykov, FOC 14: 129. 2005) prefer to treat this as *Seseli simplicifolium*.
