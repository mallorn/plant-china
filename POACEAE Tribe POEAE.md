11.**POACEAE Tribe POEAE**",

> This is a large tribe of predominantly temperate grasses, usually with a paniculate inflorescence, simple, several-flowered spikelets with the florets exserted from the glumes, and 5- or more veined lemmas.

## Description
Annual or perennial. Leaf blades linear to filiform; ligule membranous. Inflorescence usually an open or contracted panicle, rarely spikelike or a single raceme with tough rachis (fragile in *Parapholis*). Spikelets all alike or rarely dimorphic with mixed fertile and sterile spikelets, florets (1 or)2 to many with uppermost reduced, usually laterally compressed, disarticulating below each floret; glumes persistent, usually shorter than lemmas, membranous or rarely leathery; floret callus glabrous or with woolly hairs; lemmas membranous to leathery, (3–)5–7(–13)-veined, glabrous or infrequently hairy, apex entire or denticulate, awnless or with a straight or curved awn from apex; palea subequaling lemma. Lodicules 2, hyaline. Stamens (1–)3. Ovary sometimes hairy. Caryopsis mostly ellipsoid; hilum linear or round. Leaf anatomy: non-Kranz; microhairs absent. Chromosomes large. *x* = 7.
  "Statistics": "About 50 genera and 1200 species: temperate and cold regions of the world, also on tropical mountains; 16 genera and 212 species (54 endemic, at least nine introduced) in China.
