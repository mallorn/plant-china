72a.**Poa sphondylodes var. sphondylodes**",

> The type and other gatherings of *Poa kelungensis*, which are quite soft and with the uppermost internode almost equal to its blade, closely resemble the type of *P. sphondylodes*. Gatherings from sandy beaches are quite different from typical *P. sphondylodes*, but those from shady forests are closely allied and form intermediate populations. The extreme form probably represents a discrete (maybe apomictic) population, which cannot be treated without more research. The type of *P. strictula* and most gatherings so named represent a mesomorphic form of *P. sphondylodes*.
