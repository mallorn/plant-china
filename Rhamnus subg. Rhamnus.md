## Description
Shrubs or trees, usually spinescent, rarely unarmed, with terminal scaly buds and axillary buds. Leaves alternate, subopposite to opposite, or fascicled at short shoots. Flowers unisexual and plants dioecious, rarely polygamous, usually 4(or 5)-merous. Sepals adaxially with conspicuous or inconspicuous midvein. Petals spatulate, base shortly clawed, apex entire or 2-fid. Male flower with developed stamens; female flowers with rudimentary stamens. Disk thin, lining calyx tube. Ovary superior, globose, not immersed in disk, 2-4-loculed; style 2-4-cleft. Berrylike drupe subglobose or obovoid-globose, base with persistent calyx tube, with 2-4 one-seeded stones. Seeds with a ± long, narrow to gaping, often distinctly margined abaxial or lateral furrow.
