> *Cyclosorus gustavii* has only two gatherings from W Yunnan, so our knowledge about it is quite limited. The distinction between this species and *C. assamicus* (Beddome) Ching, which also occurs in NE India, is not obvious. Here, we follow the treatment in Fl. Yunnan. (20: 613. 2006).

Fronds distant; stipes 15-25 cm, dark stramineous; laminae 40-80 × 25-35 cm, bases gradually narrowed, apices caudate with a large apical pinna; lateral pinnae 10-15 pairs, lanceolate, 12-18 × 2-3 cm, lobed ca. 1/3 toward costae, bases truncate to broadly cuneate, almost sessile, apices acuminate; apical pinnae similar to lateral ones; proximal 3-5 pairs of lateral pinnae gradually shortened, lowest pair ca. 2 cm; segments 20-30 pairs on middle pinnae, 3-4 × 3-4 mm, entire, obtuse at apices; veinlets 6-12 pairs, proximal 2 or 3 pairs anastomosing, next 1-1.5 pairs running to sinus membrane. Laminae papery, grayish green when dried, with several acicular hairs along costae and veins adaxially, with short acicular hairs along veins and minute hairs between veins abaxially.
