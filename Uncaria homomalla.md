## Description
Lianas, climbing to 25 m tall. Young stems quadrate, sparsely to densely, usually ferruginous tomentulose or -hirtellous. Petiole 3-6 mm, hirtellous to strigose; leaf blade drying papery, elliptic, lanceolate, elliptic-lanceolate, or ovate-lanceolate, 6-10 × 2.5-4 cm, adaxially rather sparsely but evenly puberulent to strigillose on lamina and densely tomentulose on costa, abaxially moderately to densely hirsute or strigose with trichomes produced mostly along veins, base rounded, apex acuminate or caudate; secondary veins 6-8 pairs, usually with well-developed pilosulous domatia; stipules generally deciduous, deeply 2-lobed, lobes narrowly triangular, 4-5 mm, acute. Inflorescences axillary and sometimes also terminal, densely hirtellous to strigose; peduncles simple, 2.5-3 cm, at articulation with narrowly triangular bracts 2-3 mm; flowering heads 7-10 mm in diam. across calyces, 25-30 mm in diam. across corollas; bracteoles apparently absent. Flowers sessile. Calyx with hypanthium portion obconic, ca. 1.2 mm; limb deeply lobed; lobes linear to narrowly triangular, 0.75-1 mm, densely pilosulous, acute. Corolla yellow [to pale green], outside densely strigose to strigillose; tube 5-8.5 mm; lobes ligulate to elliptic-oblong, ca. 1.25 mm, obtuse to rounded. Fruiting heads 12-20 mm in diam. Fruit sessile, obovoid, ca. 4 × 2 mm, strigose to pilosulous; seeds 2-3 mm. Fl. Apr, May.
