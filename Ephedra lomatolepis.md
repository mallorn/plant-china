4.**Ephedra lomatolepis** Schrenk",

> H. Riedl notes that &lt;I&gt;Ephedra lomatolepis&lt;/I&gt; has seed cones light brown and dry when mature, with bracts free (as in &lt;I&gt;E. przewalskii&lt;/I&gt;), the membranous margins much wider than the herbaceous center. The characters of the male plant described here seem to apply to a taxon other than &lt;I&gt;E. lomatolepis&lt;/I&gt; (which is endemic to the Balkhash area of Kazakhstan), possibly even to a new species.
