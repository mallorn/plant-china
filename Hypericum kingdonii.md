## Description
Herbs, perennial, 15-48 cm tall, suberect to decumbent from short rooting base, with stems usually branched from upper to nearly all nodes. Stems terete, eglandular; internodes 1-2.5 cm, longer than leaves. Leaves sessile, lower soon deciduous; leaf blade broadly ovate-oblong or broadly elliptic to suborbicular, 6-14 × 3-7 mm, recurved, subpapery, abaxially pale or glaucous; laminar glands pale, punctiform, small, dense; intramarginal glands black, dense; main lateral veins 3 or 4 pairs from lower 2/5 of midvein, tertiary reticulation lax or apparently absent; base shallowly cordate to rounded, margin entire, apex rounded. Inflorescence 5-25-flowered from 1 or 2 nodes, usually with flowering branches from up to 6 nodes below and often also toward base of stem, the whole narrowly pyramidal to subcylindric. Pedicel 1-2 mm; bracts and bracteoles narrowly elliptic or linear-lanceolate, black glandular-denticulate to -fimbriate or subentire, with intercalary sessile black glands and ± well-developed black-gland-fringed auricles, persistent. Flowers 8-14 mm in diam., stellate; buds ellipsoid, apex obtuse. Sepals 5, erect in bud and fruit, equal, lanceolate to oblong-linear, 4.5-6 × (1-)1.5-2 mm, margin irregularly glandular-denticulate to -fimbriate or subentire, apex acute to subacuminate; veins 3-5, branching; laminar glands pale, linear to punctiform and often a few black, punctiform; marginal or intramarginal glands black, irregular, often between glandular cilia or fimbriae. Petals 5, ?golden yellow, not tinged red in bud, narrowly ovate, 6-8 mm, 1.3-1.5 × as long as sepals, margin entire, apex acute; laminar glands sparse to rather dense, black, striiform to punctiform; marginal glands distal and in apiculus, black. Stamens 20-25, apparently 3-fascicled, longest 5-6 mm, 0.7-0.85 × as long as petals; anther gland black. Ovary 3-loculed, ellipsoid, ca. 2 × 1 mm; styles 3, ca. 3 mm, ca. 1.5 × as long as ovary, ± divergent; stigmas narrow. Capsule narrowly ovoid to ellipsoid, 5-7 × 3.5-4.5 mm, ca. 1.1 × as long as sepals; valves with numerous longitudinal vittae. Seeds yellowish brown, ca. 0.5 mm, not carinate; testa finely scalariform.
