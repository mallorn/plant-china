80e.**Poa albertii subsp. lahulensis** (Bor) Olonova & G. Zhu",

> The types of both *Poa lahulensis* and *P. borealitibetica* differ from other members of this complex by being more mesomorphic and look like dwarf plants of *P. versicolor* subsp. *relaxa*, with leaf blades softer and withering with age, panicles lax, and spikelets larger. The pubescence between the veins can vary, as far as complete absence, but other characters are quite constant. This might be evidence of the contribution of *P. versicolor* subsp. *relaxa* to the genotype of *P. albertii* subsp. *lahulensis*. More research is needed to find out the relationships and parentage of the subspecies of *P. albertii*, since subsp. *lahulensis* might not be of hybrid orgin but instead a direct derivate of *P. versicolor* subsp. *relaxa*.

## Description
Culms 10–20 cm tall, nodes 1 or 2. Leaf blade flat or folded, quite soft, 3–5 cm × 1.5–2.5 mm, both surfaces scabrid, frequently withering; ligule 1–3 mm. Panicle elliptic, 4–6 × 1.5–3 cm, branches 2 or 3 per node. Spikelets obovate, green or slightly tinged with purple, 4.5–6 mm, florets 3–6; glumes broadly lanceolate; lemma oblong-lanceolate, slightly membranous, keel and marginal veins densely pubescent below middle, areas between veins proximally pubescent; callus glabrous or minutely hairy.

> Alpine grasslands; 2000–5500 m. Xizang, Yunnan [India].
