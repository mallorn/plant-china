> This species is very similar to *Hippuris vulgaris* but is traditionally separated by its shorter, 4-whorled leaves. These characters are to some extent under environmental control, being present at low temperatures or high salinity. *Hippuris tetraphylla* is commonly recognized in Europe and North America but less so in Asia.
