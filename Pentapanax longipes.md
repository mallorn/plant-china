8.**Pentapanax longipes** (Merrill) C. B. Shang & C. F. Ji",

> The oldest name for this species is *Gamblea longipes*, for which *Aralia kingdon-wardii* is a nomen novum recently proposed because the combination *A. longipes* Truffaut had already been made for another species. In *Pentapanax*, however, the specific epithet *\"longipes\"* is available and is accordingly combined here.
