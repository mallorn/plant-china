## Description
Rhizomes procumbent, with fascicled fibrous roots. Stem solitary, erect, ca. 50 cm tall, 4-6 mm in diam. at base, angulate, subglabrous except on synflorescence branches, paniculate synflorescences branched above, upward subcurved. Basal leaves withered and fallen at anthesis. Lower stem leaf petioles 4-6.5 cm, not winged, hispidulous, rather expanded at base but without auricle; leaf blade triangular-hastate, 7.5-15 × 10-18 cm, base broadly cordate or subcordate, shortly decurrent, margin with fine or stout teeth, teeth triangular and mucronulate, apex long acute or acuminate; lateral lobes furcate, acute or 2-lobulate; basal lobes longer, narrowly triangular. Upper stem leaves similar, gradually smaller. Uppermost leaves shortly petiolate, sometimes ovate or narrowly ovate, basally 3-veined, palmately divaricate, connected before margins, lateral and reticulate veins slightly prominent on both surfaces, base rounded. Capitula numerous, terminal and in upper leaf axils, pyramidal paniculate; synflorescence branches spreading, sparsely or densely yellow pubescent; peduncles 1.5-2 mm, hispidulous, basally with linear-lanceolate bractlets; bractlets 3-7 mm, rarely to 15 mm or shorter than 3 mm. Involucres cylindric, 9-11 × 2-3 mm; phyllaries 5, linear-lanceolate, 1.5-2 mm wide, outside pubescent, margin narrowly scarious, apically acute. Florets 5 or 6; corolla yellow, often exceeding involucre, with 3.5-4.5 mm tube and narrowly campanulate limb; lobes lanceolate, ca. 2 mm, apically sparsely puberulent. Anthers exserted from corolla, basally caudate. Style branches excurved, truncate, papillose. Achenes cylindric, ca. 4 mm, glabrous, ribbed. Pappus white, equaling corolla lobes. Fl. Jul, fr. Sep.
