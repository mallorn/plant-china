2.**ROSACEAE Subfam. MALOIDEAE**",

> The taxonomy of this subfamily is particularly challenging because of hybridization, polyploidy, and apomixis, especially for large genera.&lt;p&gt;This account follows the FRPS circumscription of genera; however, for an alternative treatment of genera, the reader can refer to Robertson et al. (Syst. Bot. 16: 376–394. 1991).

## Description
Shrubs or trees. Leaves simple or compound, margin serrate or entire; stipules present, persistent or caducous. Carpels (1 or)2–5(–7), mostly ± connate and then united with inside of cupular receptacle, with 2, rarely 1 or several, erect anatropous ovules per carpel; ovary inferior or semi-inferior, rarely superior. Fruit usually a pome, sometimes berrylike. x = 17.
  "Statistics": "Between 20 and 28 genera and 940–1100 species: 16 genera (one endemic) and 273 species (165 endemic) in China.
