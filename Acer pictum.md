> One of us (Chang) believes that *Acer pictum* subsp. *macropterum*, subsp. *mono*, subsp. *pictum*, subsp. *pubigerum*, and subsp. *tricuspis* so closely resemble each other that they may be taken for one variable and widely distributed taxon. However, one of us (Chen) believes that some of the subspecies are good and differ in their distributions; while awaiting future results about their status, it is best to retain their subspecific status. de Jong notes that *A. pictum* is a very complex species requiring further study.
