毛果缺顶杜鹃
175.**Rhododendron poilanei** Dop

> *Rhododendron emarginatum* var. *eriocarpum*, described from Guangxi and Yunnan, is synonymous with *R*. *poilanei*, described from N Vietnam. These two taxa share a hairy ovary with *R*. euonymifolium, which could, if also synonymous, be the earliest name for the species (H. Léveillé, Repert. Spec. Nov. Regni Veg. 12: 103. 1913). One of the syntypes of the latter species, *Esquirol 661* (E), is very poor but has ovaries, all of which are hairy. However, there is some confusion, as the other, rather more complete syntype, *J*. *Cavalerie 264* (E), has both hairy and hairless ovaries. This is the crucial character separating *R*. *poilanei* from the more or less sympatric *R*. emarginatum. It appears that designation of a lectotype is required.
