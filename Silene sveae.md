> &lt;I&gt; Silene sveae &lt;/I&gt; is easily distinguished from &lt;I&gt; S. caespitella &lt;/I&gt; by its few broad basal leaves, from &lt;I&gt; S. nepalensis &lt;/I&gt; by being smaller in all its parts, and from both species by its grayish, slightly fleshy habit, overwintering leaf rosette, few-flowered inflorescence, prominent, forward-projecting petal auricles, and narrow, deeply bifid petal limbs.
