## Description
Herbs, perennial. Stems twining or trailing, sometimes rooting at nodes, slender, villous. Leaves pinnately 3-foliolate; stipules ovate to ovate-lanceolate, 2-3 mm, with longitudinal striations, persistent; petiole 2.5-6 cm; stipels small, setiform; petiolules short, 1-2 mm, terminal one longer; leaflets thinly papery, terminal leaflet elliptic, oblong, or subovate, 2.6-10 × 1.5-6.8 cm, sparsely villous on both surfaces, lateral veins 5-7 on each side, slender, merging near margin, base obtuse or rounded, apex acute; lateral leaflets slightly small, slightly oblique. Raceme with 2-4 flowers near apex; peduncle 2.5-7 cm; bracts similar to stipules in shape; bracteoles broadly ovate to broadly elliptic, obviously striate, adpressed to calyx, larger than bracts. Calyx 5-lobed; upper 2 lobes ± connate, lowest longest, linear. Corolla white, pink, or light purple, 2-3 cm; standard broadly orbicular, densely villous abaxially, with short spur near base; wings falcate-obovate, one side with curved auricle, almost semicircular, each petal shortly clawed. Legume linear, 7-13 × 0.5-0.6 cm, compressed, apex acuminate, beak straight, slender, 8-15 mm; valves convex to ridge from both sutures, twisting at dehiscence. Seeds 7-15, brownish black or yellowish green with dark mottling, oblong, 4-5 mm; hilum short. Fl. Nov-Apr, fr. Jan-Jul. 2*n* = 22.
  "Reference": "Fantz (Sida 17: 321-332. 1996) showed that the material widely used for herbage and as a green fertilizer by agronomists under the name *Centrosema pubescens* belongs to two distinct species: the ma-jority to *C. molle* and the remainder to *C. pubescens* sensu stricto. How-ever, because the identity of the available Chinese material is not clear, the name *C. pubescens* is used here in its old, inclusive sense. Wiersema and Kirkbride (Taxon 54: 209-210. 2005) proposed conservation of the name *C. pubescens* with a conserved type. If this proposal is successful, the correct name for the taxon currently known as *C. pubescens* sensu stricto will be *C. schiedeanum*, and that for *C. molle* will be *C. pubes-cens*. There is ongoing debate on the desirability of such a change, and it is possible that the name *C. pubescens* might instead be rejected to avoid confusion resulting from a change in its correct usage, in which case the name *C. schiedeanum* would again be correct, while *C. molle* would remain in use. The two species may be distinguished as follows: *C. molle*: bracts 4-6 × 1-2 mm, puberulous; pedicels 6-9 mm at an-thesis; bracteoles 6-9 × 4-6 mm; seeds brownish black; *C. pubescens*: bracts 6-9 × 3-6 mm, sericeous; pedicels 3-6 mm at anthesis; brac-teoles 10-16 × 6-9 mm; seeds yellowish green.Fantz (Sida 17: 321-332. 1996) showed that the material widely used for herbage and as a green fertilizer by agronomists under the name *Centrosema pubescens* belongs to two distinct species: the ma-jority to *C. molle* and the remainder to *C. pubescens* sensu stricto.
