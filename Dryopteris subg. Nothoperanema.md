> *Dryopteris* subg. *Nothoperanema* can be divided into four sections. All four sections are strongly supported as monophyletic based on molecular and morphological evidence (Li Bing Zhang et al., BMC Evol. Biol. 12: 180. 2012). In fact, the four sections are strikingly different in morphology and are often treated as different genera.Three of us (Wang, Xing, and Wu), however, prefer to keep the three sections, *Dryopteris* sect. *Acrophorus*, *D.* sect. *Diacalpe*, and *D.* sect. *Peranema*, as genera in the family Peranemataceae.
