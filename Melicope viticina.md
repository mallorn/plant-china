Inflorescences axillary and sometimes basal to leaves, 0.5-5(-8.5) × 0.7-1.8(-2) cm; peduncle obsolete or to 2.5 cm; larger primary branches spreading or ascending. Pedicel 0.5-1.5 mm but 1.5-3 mm in fruit, glabrous to sparsely puberulent. Sepals 1-1.8 mm, connate at base, glabrous or outside sparsely puberulent, persistent in fruit. Petals 2.5-3 mm, persistent or rarely deciduous in fruit. Stamens 4, in male and bisexual flowers 2.2-3 mm, in female flowers 0.8-1.5 mm; filaments at least in male and bisexual flowers obtuse or narrowly so at apex. Gynoecium in female and bisexual flowers 1.5-2 mm, in male flowers 0.3-0.6 mm; ovary glabrous or rarely sparsely pubescent. Fruit follicles subglobose to ellipsoid, 5-7 mm, glabrous.
