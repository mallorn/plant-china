## Description
Herbs, shrublets, shrubs, or rarely small trees. Stipules often scarious, usually basally adnate to petiole and sometimes connate around stem. Leaves imparipinnate, paripinnate, 1-foliolate, or sometimes rachis reduced and apparently digitately compound; stipels absent; leaflets opposite, margin entire. Racemes axillary, sometimes shortened and apparently fasciculate or reduced to a solitary flower; bract and bracteoles small. Corolla marcescent or deciduous; standard generally narrowed to a short claw; wings sometimes very reduced; keel with leading edge ± truncate. Stamens diadelphous (9+1); vexillary stamen free or connate in middle with others; anthers uniform, dorsifixed, with broad connective. Ovary 1- to several ovuled. Legume mostly articulate and moniliform or flat-tened, some not articulate or reduced to a single article, indehiscent, often with bristles or spines. Seeds reni-form or subreniform, with a small hilum.
