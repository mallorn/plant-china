## Description
Herbs, scandent, perennial or annual, glabrous. Stems thin, 1-8 m, forming a sympodium of several shoots. Leaf blade ternately or pinnately compound; leaflets once to 3 × compound; apex of leaf transformed into a branched tendril (except in basalmost leaves). Inflorescences terminal (leaf-opposed), corymbose, pendent, 2-14-flowered; bracts linear, entire to fimbriate-dentate. Flowers with 2 planes of symmetry, cordate to oblong, 12-26 × 4-10 mm. Petals pale yellow to orange (often rubescent); apices of outer petals slightly bent outward, base pouchlike. Stamens 2 (i.e., filaments of each triplet completely fused); each stamen with a basal nectary extending into pouch of corresponding outer petal. Style persistent; stigma almost square, upper corners each with 1 small stigmatic papilla, basal corners each with 1 large papilla (small in *Dactylicapnos burmanica*). Capsule dehiscent with 2 valves with persistent replum (in *D. scandens* indehiscent and berrylike). Seeds several to many, carunculate.
  "Reference": "*Dactylicapnos ventii* (Khánh) Lidén (Nordic J. Bot. 25: 35. 2008) is similar to *D. grandifoliolata* but has fruit lanceolate with thin walls and seeds evenly colliculate and slightly flattened. It is known from India (Sikkim) and might occur in Yadong, S Xizang.*Dactylicapnos ventii* (Khánh) Lidén (Nordic J.
