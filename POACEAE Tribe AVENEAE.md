12.**POACEAE Tribe AVENEAE**",

> Recent molecular studies show the tribes *Poeae* and *Aveneae* to be closely related and to some extent interleaved, with certain genera traditionally placed in one tribe ordered at a molecular level within the other. On this account the tribes are sometimes united into a broadly defined *Poeae*. However, most genera can be easily assigned to one or other tribe on morphological characteristics, and therefore the traditional treatment is maintained here.

## Description
Annual or perennial. Leaf blades linear to setaceous; ligule membranous. Inflorescence an open, contracted, or spikelike panicle. Spikelets all alike, somewhat laterally compressed, with 1 to several fertile florets; rachilla usually disarticulating below each floret, occasionally strictly 3 florets with lower 2 staminate or barren and of different appearance from upper fertile floret, then disarticulating above glumes and florets falling together; glumes persistent, often equal to spikelet or at least longer than first floret, commonly membranous with broad, shining, hyaline margins; floret callus bearded; lemmas hyaline to leathery, 3- to several-veined (*Coleanthus* 1-veined), apex entire or denticulate, awned from back, rarely awnless; awn usually geniculate with twisted column; palea hyaline, subequaling or much shorter than lemma. Lodicules 2, rarely absent. Stamens (2 or)3, rarely 1 (*Cinna*). Caryopsis mostly ellipsoid; hilum round or oval, endosperm sometimes soft or liquid. Starch-grains compound. Chromosomes large; basic number 7 (5 in *Anthoxanthum*). Leaf anatomy:non-Kranz, microhairs absent, silica-bodies oblong.
  "Statistics": "About 60 genera: temperate and cold regions of the world, extending to mountains in the tropics; 20 genera, one hybrid genus, and 144 species (40 endemic, 11 or 12 introduced) in China.
