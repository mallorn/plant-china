1.**Anogeissus acuminata** (Roxburgh ex Candolle) Guillemin et al.",

> In FRPS (53(1): 2. 1984), Chinese plants were treated as *Anogeissus acuminata* var. *lanceolata*. However, that entity does not seem sufficiently distinct from typical *A. acuminata* to justify formal taxonomic recognition. Scott (Kew Bull. 33: 563-565. 1979) recognized two varieties within *A. acuminata*: var. *acuminata* (including var. *lanceolata*), occurring from India to Vietnam, and var. *phillyreifolia* (Van Heurck &amp; Müller Argoviensis) Kurz, apparently restricted to Myanmar. The species was listed as endangered in China by Shun (in Fu &amp; Jin, China Pl. Red Data Book 1: 220-221. 1992).
