裂苞舟瓣芹",
1b.**Sinolimprichtia alpina var. dissecta** R. H. Shan & S. L. Liou",

> This high-altitude, short, stout plant, with characteristic, highly dissected bracteoles, is more commonly collected than the typical variety. This plant is superficially very similar to *Ligusticum* *capillaceum* and has often been confused with it. *Ligusticum* *capillaceum* is generally hirsute, especially along the leaf rachis, rays, pedicels, bracts, and bracteoles, has lacerate bracteoles with acute lobes, and greatly dorsally compressed fruit. *Sinolimprichtia* *alpina* var. *dissecta* is completely glabrous, has smooth-margined bracteoles with rounded lobes, and slightly laterally compressed fruit.

## Description
Bracteoles broadly obovate in outline, 10–20 × 6–15 mm, exceeding umbellule, 2–3-pinnate.

> Alpine grassy slopes, screes, rock crevices; 3500–4800 m. SW Sichuan, SE Xizang, NW Yunnan.
