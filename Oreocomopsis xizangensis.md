西藏羽苞芹",
1.**Oreocomopsis xizangensis** Pimenov & Kljuykov",

> This rather poorly known taxon is recorded from only a few collections. One of us (Pu) has examined no specimens. The species is closely allied to *Oreocomopsis* *stelliphora* (Cauwet &amp; Farille) Pimenov &amp; Kljuykov, from Nepal, in having bracts foliaceous and bracteoles 2–3 × as long as umbellules, but it differs most noticeably in having pilose rays, bracts, and bracteoles; rays 12–26 (vs. 6–8); and calyx teeth absent (vs. evident).
