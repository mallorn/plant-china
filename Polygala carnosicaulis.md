24.**Polygala carnosicaulis** W. H. Chen & Y. M. Shui",

> One of us (Parnell) prefers to treat this as a variety of *Polygala isocarpa*, differing in its punctate seeds and fleshy stems; however, two of us (Chen and Ma) recognize it as a good species because of its distinct stem and larger seeds.
