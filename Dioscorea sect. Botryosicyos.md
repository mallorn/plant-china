6.**Dioscorea sect. Botryosicyos** (Hochstetter) Uline",

> Prain and Burkill treated the members of this section within &lt;I&gt; Dioscorea&lt;/I&gt; sect. &lt;I&gt; Lasiophyton&lt;/I&gt; but the differences in leaflet venation, male bracts, stamen number, and chemistry justify the resurrection of &lt;I&gt; D.&lt;/I&gt; sect. &lt;I&gt; Botryosicyos&lt;/I&gt;.

## Description
Rootstock of perennial tubers irregular in shape. Stem twining to left. Bulblets present or absent. Leaves alternate, palmately 3--9-foliolate; leaflets ± orbicular to narrowly lanceolate, pinnately veined, margin entire; lateral leaflets similar to central one. Male inflorescences of spikes or racemes clustered or in panicles. Flowers solitary, pedicellate; bract and bracteole(s) borne on pedicel or at base of perianth, often forming an involucel around flower; perianth lobes connate at base; stamens usually 3, alternating with 3 staminodes. Female spike occasionaly branched. Capsule reflexed at maturity, longer than wide. Seeds inserted near apex of capsule; wing pointing toward capsule base.
