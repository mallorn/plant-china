Leaves cauline, opposite, petiolate (petioles usually winged) or sessile; blade usually deltate to ovate, usually palmately lobed, both surfaces hirtellous, pilosulose, or puberulent, gland-dotted (at least abaxially), ultimate margin dentate to denticulate. Capitula radiate, borne singly or 2-5 in crowded, corymbiform arrays; involucres hemispheric, 8-15 mm in diam.; phyllaries persistent, 12 or 13(-25) in 2 series, herbaceous, inner as many as ray florets, more membranous to scarious, narrower and shorter. Receptacles flat to convex, paleate, paleae obovate to spatulate, scarious.
