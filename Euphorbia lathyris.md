32.**Euphorbia lathyris** Linnaeus

> *Euphorbia lathyris* is a very isolated species that is adventive in many parts of the world. It is probably native only in the Mediterranean region.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seeds are used medicinally. The seed oil (ca. 50%) can also be widely used in industry, and there has been some work on the development of *Euphorbia lathyris* as a commercial crop, particularly by the selection of forms with indehiscent fruits.
