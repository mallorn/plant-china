> Five genera and 38 species: worldwide in aquatic ecosystems; four genera and eight (possibly nine) species in China.

## Description
Herbs, mostly perennial, minute, aquatic, floating or submersed, reduced to small green bodies called fronds corresponding partly to leaf and partly to stem. Roots absent or 1-21, filiform, arising from lower surface of frond; root hairs absent. Fronds 1 to many coherent together, orbicular or oblong to lanceolate and flat or convex (gibbous) on lower surface, or globose to ovoid, 0.4-15 mm, with or without veins; daughter fronds successively formed from 1 basal cavity or 2 basal pouches detaching or remaining attached for many weeks, bases of pouches sometimes surrounded by a small, membranous scale (prophyll) covering bases of roots. Node (point of origin of veins, roots, and daughter fronds) situated ca. 1/3 from base toward apex. Turions (in some species) formed under unfavorable conditions, frondlike but smaller, compact, sinking to bottom. Flowers (interpreted as inflorescences by some authors) rarely seen in most species, 1(or 2), emerging from one of pouches or from a cavity near median line on upper surface, sometimes surrounded by a small, utricular, membranous scale (corresponding to a spathe in the Araceae); perianth absent; stamens 1 or 2; pollen grains ulcerate, exine spinulose; ovary 1, bottle-shaped, 1-7-ovuled, tapering into short style; stigma funnel-shaped. Fruit indehiscent, opening by bursting.
  "Reference": "In the opinion of the present authors, it is too early to decide if the Lemnaceae should be included within the Araceae. While this placement has been supported by some phylogenetic studies, only a few species of Lemnaceae have been investigated so far. Before the whole spectrum of variability of molecular characteristics of the Lemnaceae is known, it would be unwise to change the status. The Lemnaceae are a well-characterized entity of taxa, whereas the Araceae are a heterogeneous group. It is very difficult to find common characters in the Lemnaceae and Araceae. The flowering organ is not at all decisive. It is not even certain if the flowering organ of the Lemnaceae is a flower or a reduced inflorescence. It is also very difficult to find special common characters between Lemnaceae and the genera that are placed nearest to them according to phylogenetic studies.In the opinion of the present authors, it is too early to decide if the Lemnaceae should be included within the Araceae.

**浮萍科 LEMNACEAE**

飘浮或沉水小草本。茎不发育，以圆形或长圆形的小叶状体形式存在；叶状体绿色，扁平，稀背面强烈凸起。叶不存在或退化为细小的膜质鳞片而位于茎的基部。根丝状，有的无根。很少开花，主要为无性繁殖：在叶状体边缘的小囊（侧囊）中形成小的叶状体，幼叶状体逐渐长大从小囊中浮出。新植物体或者与母体联系在一起，或者后来分离。花单 性，无花被，着生于茎基的侧囊中。雌花单一，雌蕊葫芦状，花柱短，柱头全缘，短漏斗状，1室；胚珠1-6，直立，直生或半倒生；外珠被不盖住珠孔。雄花有雄蕊1，具花丝，2室或4室，每一花序常包括1个雌花和1-2个雄花，外围以膜质佛焰苞。果不开裂，种子1-6，外种皮厚，肉质，内种皮薄，于珠孔上形成一层厚的种盖。胚具短的下位胚轴，子叶大，几完全抱合胚茎。

4属，约30种。除北极区外，全球广布。我国有3属6种。

本科大多数种类繁殖快，蛋白质含量高，为常用的饲料，猪和家禽都喜食。也是常用的中草药。

花均未见，这里仅据文献记述。
