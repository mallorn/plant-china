桃花猕猴桃",
49.**Actinidia persicina** R. G. Li & L. Mo",

> Introduced from Rongshui Xian in 1992, this species is cultivated in the research orchard of the Guangxi Institute of Botany, Guilin. The name was not validly published by Li and Mo in 2003 because no type was indicated (*Vienna Code*, Art. 37.1). The apparent earlier homonym, *\"Actinidia persicina\"* (R. H. Huang &amp; S. M. Wang, J. Wuhan Bot. Res. 13(2): 113. 1995) was not validly published because the herbarium in which the type is conserved was not specified (Art. 37.7).
