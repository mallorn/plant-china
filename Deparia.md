> The type of this hybrid is morphologically intermediate between *Deparia liangshanensis* var. *sericea* and *D. sichuanensis*. It is similar to *D. liangshanensis* in the multicellular long hairs on the surface of indusia but differs by the pinna segments without long multicellular hairs at margin, at most occasionally with few short hairs between teeth. The hairs on pinna segments are much denser than in *D. sichuanensis*. The spores are mostly abortive.● 1300-1400 m. Gansu (Kangxian).&lt;b&gt;Deparia ×nanchuanense&lt;/b&gt; (Ching &amp; Z. Y. Liu), Z. R. He, &lt;b&gt;comb. nov.&lt;/b&gt;南川对囊蕨 nan chuan dui nang jueBasionym: *Lunathyrium ×nanchuanense* Ching &amp; Z. Y. Liu, Bull. Bot. Res., Harbin 3(4): 15. 1983, pro sp.This hybrid is morphologically intermediate between *Deparia shennongensis* and *D. vegetior*. It is similar to *D. vegetior* in the hairs on the abaxial surface of rachis and costae very thin, short, and sparse, and multicellular hairs absent at sinuses between pinna segments, and multicellular hairs on the adaxial surface of veins in fertile pinnae very short. It is also similar to *D. shennongensis* in the lower pinnae gradually shortened and spore surface with rugate folds or baculate processes. Some spores in each sporangium are abortive.● Forests; 1600-1700 m. Chongqing (Jinfo Shan).The following regions comprise the center of distribution in China: Qin Ling, W Hubei, Sichuan, and NE Yunnan.The following taxon is excluded from the present treatment, pending further research: *Lunathyrium ebeneostipes* Ching &amp; Z. Y. Liu (Bull. Bot. Res., Harbin 3(4): 14. 1983), described from Sichuan (Nanchuan).&lt;b&gt;Putative Hybrids&lt;/b&gt;From abortive spores and morphological features of specimens, many hybrids can be considered. Here only two hybrids that have been published as “species” are listed.&lt;b&gt;Deparia ×kanghsienense&lt;/b&gt; (Ching &amp; Y. P. Hsu) Z. R. He, &lt;b&gt;comb. nov.&lt;/b&gt;康县对囊蕨 kang xian dui nang jueBasionym: *Lunathyrium ×kanghsienense* Ching &amp; Y. P. Hsu, Fl. Tsinling. 2: 212. 1974, pro sp.There are other formerly undescribed species, e.g., “Lunathyrium subimbricatum” (Ching in Y. L. Zhang et al., Sporae Pterid. Sin. 233, t. 45, f. 21, 25. 1976; 栉比蛾眉蕨 jie bi e mei jue) in broad-leaved forests, rock crevices, watersides, 2700-2800 m, W Yunnan (Yongping); and “Lunathyrium heterocarpum” (Ching in Y. L. Zhang et al., Sporae Pterid. Sin. 232, t. 46, f. 10, 15. 1976; 杂果蛾眉蕨 za guo e mei jue) in forests on mountain slopes, ca. 3300 m, Sichuan (Li Xian). The former is similar to Deparia sichuanensis, but the plant is larger with basal pinna segments prominently broadened. It is also similar to *D. wilsonii*. The spores are completely abortive. The latter hybrid is intermediate between *D. dolosa* and *D. shennongensis* in its pinnae to 30 pairs or more, pinna segments to 20 pairs or more, and rachis and costae with rather dense multicellular long hairs abaxially. The spores are partly abortive, and “good” spores are variable in size.
