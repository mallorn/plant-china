23a.**Fimbristylis dichotoma subsp. dichotoma**

## Description
Culms (5-)15-50 cm. Leaves slightly shorter to sometimes slightly longer than culm; leaf blade linear, 1-2.5 mm wide. Inflorescence a compound or rarely simple anthela. Spikelets 4.5-8.5 mm. Fertile glumes 2.2-3 mm. Nutlet obovoid to broadly so, 0.6-1.2 mm, with 5-11 vertical rows of transversely oblong epidermal cells, apex rounded to obtuse. Fl. and fr. Jul-Oct. 2*n* = 10, 20.

  "Reference": "Within *Fimbristylis dichotoma* subsp. *dichotoma* two varieties could be recognized in China, i.e., *F. dichotoma* var. *dichotoma* and *F. dichotoma* var. *tikushiensis*. The latter can be separated by its mostly single spikelets that are 7.5-8.5 mm in contrast to var. *dichotoma* with spikelets clustered and 5.5-8 mm. In var. *tikushiensis* styles of the fruiting state are elongated exposing them beyond the glume apex, but in var. *dichotoma* styles at the fruiting state are still enclosed by the subtending glume. In typical subsp. *dichotoma* plants tend to be biennials or short-lived perennials often with a very short rhizome, whereas in var. *tikushiensis* plants are typically annual without a rhizome.Within *Fimbristylis dichotoma* subsp. *dichotoma* two varieties could be recognized in China, i.e., *F. dichotoma* var. *dichotoma* and *F. dichotoma* var. *tikushiensis*.
