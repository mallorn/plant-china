## Description
Annual to perennial, acaulescent, scapose, or caulescent herbs, more rarely subshrubs, exceptionally scandent vines, latex present. Leaves alternate, frequently rosulate. Capitulum solitary or capitula loosely to more densely aggregated, sometimes forming a secondary capitulum, ligulate, homogamous, with 3-5 to ca. 300 but mostly with a few dozen bisexual florets. Receptacle naked, or more rarely with scales or bristles. Involucre cylindric to campanulate, ± differentiated into a few imbricate outer series of phyllaries and a longer inner series, rarely uniseriate. Florets with 5-toothed ligule, pale yellow to deep orange-yellow, or of some shade of blue, including whitish or purple, rarely white; anthers basally calcarate and caudate, apical appendage elongate, smooth, filaments smooth; style slender, with long, slender branches, sweeping hairs on shaft and branches; pollen echinolophate or echinate. Achene cylindric, or fusiform to slenderly obconoidal, usually ribbed, sometimes compressed or flattened, apically truncate, attenuate, cuspidate, or beaked, often sculptured, mostly glabrous, sometimes papillose or hairy, rarely villous, sometimes heteromorphic; pappus of scabrid [to barbellate] or plumose bristles, rarely of scales or absent.
