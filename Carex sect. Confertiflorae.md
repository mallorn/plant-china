## Description
Involucral bracts sheathed or not sheathed. Spikes unisexual; terminal spikes male; lateral spikes female (*Carex olivacea* with a few male flowers at apex), long cylindric, densely many flowered. Female glumes ovate-lanceolate, apex aristate (*C. ischnostachya* and *C. subtumida* with female glumes ovate, not mucronate or aristate). Utricles dark brown or brown-green, ovate or elliptic, inflated trigonous, nearly horizontally patent or ± reflexed low in some species, many veined, beak ± long or slightly short, rather long in few species, orifice 2-toothed. Nutlets rather loosely enveloped; stigmas 3.
