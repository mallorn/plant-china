> &lt;I&gt;Cardamine multijuga&lt;/I&gt;, which was previously reduced to the synonymy of &lt;I&gt;C. griffithii&lt;/I&gt;, is known only from older collections. However, it is readily distinguished from &lt;I&gt;C. griffithii&lt;/I&gt; by having cauline leaves with (7 or)8-11(-15) pairs of nonciliate lateral leaflets, spreading sepals, petals, and stamens, subequal stamens, entire stigmas, and styles 3-4 mm. By contrast, &lt;I&gt;C. griffithii&lt;/I&gt; has cauline leaves with 2-4(or 5) pairs of ciliate lateral leaflets, erect sepals, petals, and stamens, tetradynamous stamens, strongly 2-lobed stigmas, and styles 0.5-1(-2) mm.

## Description

Uppermost leaves smaller. Fruiting pedicels divaricate, 1-2 cm, slender, straight. Sepals oblong, 2.5-3 × 1.5-2 mm, spreading. Petals purple or lavender, obovate, 7-9 × 3-4 mm, not clawed, apex rounded. Filaments spreading, subequal, 4-5 mm; anthers narrowly oblong, 1.5-1.7 mm. Ovules 10-16 per ovary.
