## Description
Morphological characters and geographical distribution are the same as those of the family.
  "Reference": "*Acorus* has been considered for a long time to be a member of the Araceae and only recently has it been removed from the family, although the family Acoraceae was already established in 1820. There are a number of significant characters that distinguish *Acorus* from the Araceae: unifacial leaves, two separate vascular systems in the peduncle, absence of raphides, presence of perisperm and endosperm in the seeds (never a perisperm in Araceae), trichomes on the micropyle of the ovules, and presence of special ethereal oil cells and other anatomical characters; laticifers are also lacking but quite a number of Araceae are also without them. DNA studies show that *Acorus* is a sister taxon to all other monocots, which means that it is not closely related to the Araceae at all.*Acorus* has been considered for a long time to be a member of the Araceae and only recently has it been removed from the family, although the family Acoraceae was already established in 1820.
