Herbs, perennial, rarely subshrubs; rhizome woody; herbage sometimes or partly long white lanate or cottony, stipitate glandular. Leaves alternate, basal and lower cauline long or shortly petiolate, blade lanceolate, ovate-lanceolate, oblong, orbicular, or cordate, margin coarsely serrate, mid and upper cauline sessile, often decurrent. Capitula ± large, few to numerous in corymbiform synflorescences, rarely solitary, radiate. Involucre hemispheric or cup-shaped; phyllaries 2-4-seriate, unequal to equal, herbaceous, rarely papery, multiveined, margins of inner narrowly scarious, outer glandular or long hairy. Receptacles flat or slightly convex, ± alveolate, naked. Ray florets outer with lamina yellow, reddish, or brownish, surpassing or ± equaling phyllaries, inner 2- or 3-seriate, rarely few or absent, tubular, elaminate, shorter than styles; disk functionally male, yellow, narrowly funnelform, 5-lobed, lobes lanceolate to linear-lanceolate, often glandular; anther bases obtuse or acute; style branches of ray florets linear-lanceolate, long, of disk ± appressed together, lanceolate, ± short, densely hairy (outer), without receptive papillae. Achenes brown, oblong, sparsely strigose, pale 8-10-veined. Pappus of few short, thin bristles (sometimes absent), and many long, coarse or thin, long-barbellate bristles, those of disk sometimes few, short, thin.
