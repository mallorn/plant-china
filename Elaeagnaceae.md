> The fruits of many members of this family are edible, and some species of both *Elaeagnus* and *Hippophae* are widely utilized and sometimes cultivated as fruit trees. They are a particularly good source of Vitamin C. Several species are also grown as ornamental garden shrubs. The roots are able to fix atmospheric nitrogen making it possible for plants to grow well on very poor soils. For this reason, some species, most notably *Elaeagnus angustifolia*, have been used for land reclamation.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chang Che-yung. 1983.
