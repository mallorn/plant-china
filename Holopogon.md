## Description
Herbs, small, heteromycotrophic, with short rhizomes and tufted fleshy roots, without green leaves. Inflorescence erect, terminal, racemose, sparsely papillose-pubescent above; peduncle with several tubular sheaths; rachis several to many flowered, sparsely papillose-pubescent; floral bracts membranous. Flowers erect or spreading, resupinate or not, actinomorphic or less commonly zygomorphic; pedicel rather long. Sepals similar, outer surfaces usually sparsely hairy. Petals similar, or central one a modified lip 2-lobed at apex. Column rather long, slightly dilated at apex, with a thick ridge on dorsal surface; anther erect or suberect, attached by a filament to ridge on back of column; pollinia 2, granular-farinaceous, soft, without caudicles or viscidia; stigma terminal; rostellum absent.
  "Reference": "In the opinion of one of us (Chen), this genus is characterized by its very distinct column structure, in which there is a thick ridge on its dorsal surface linked at the upper end by a filament to the suberect anther, and a terminal stigma, but no rostellum. This is a reliable and stable character found in all the species, including those with a modified lip very similar to that in *Neottia*. For a detailed discussion, see Chen and Tsi (Acta Phytotax. Sin. 25: 329-339. 1987).In the opinion of one of us (Chen), this genus is characterized by its very distinct column structure, in which there is a thick ridge on its dorsal surface linked at the upper end by a filament to the suberect anther, and a terminal stigma, but no rostellum.

腐生小草本，具短缩的根状茎和成簇的肉质纤维根。茎直立，无绿叶，上部被乳突状疏柔毛，中部以下具数枚圆筒状鞘。总状花序顶生，具数花至多花；花序轴被乳突状疏柔毛；花苞片膜质；花梗较长；花直立或斜展，扭转或不扭转；萼片相似，背面常被疏毛；花瓣3枚相似或中央1枚变为特化的唇瓣，后者明显大于花瓣且先端2裂；蕊柱较长，顶端稍扩大，背侧多少有龙骨状脊；脊一般粗厚，向上延伸而成花丝；花药通常以基部着生于花丝上，直立或近直立；花粉团2个，粒粉质，柔软，无花粉团柄，亦不附着于粘盘上；柱头顶生；蕊喙不存在。

共6种，产东亚至印度西北部。我国有2种。
