甘南杜鹃",
404.**Rhododendron gannanense** Z. C. Feng & X. G. Sun",

> This species was diagnosed by the original authors as differing from *Rhododendron wallichii* in having a short inflorescence rachis, glandular pedicel and calyx, shorter, pink corolla (2–3 cm), and glabrous filaments. The present authors have seen no material and are therefore uncertain of its true affinities, although from the protologue it appears perfectly distinct from *R*. *wallichii*.
