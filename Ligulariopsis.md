## Description
Herbs, perennial. Rhizomes robust, short, with many fibrous roots. Stem with relict petioles at base. Leaves alternate, papery, basal leaves persistent by anthesis, long petiolate, oblong-cordate or broadly ovate-cordate, base cuneate, decurrent into winged petiole; petiole basally expanded and subamplexicaul, but not vaginate. Median leaves similar to lower leaves but smaller, shortly petiolate; petiole winged, gradually expanded from middle to base into leaflike ovate auricles, amplexicaul. Capitula discoid, in terminal racemes; peduncles with 2 bractlets. Involucres cylindric or narrowly campanulate, 1.5-2 mm in diam., not calyculate; phyllaries uniseriate, 4, linear-lanceolate, margin narrowly scarious. Receptacle foveolate. Florets 4, discoid, distinctly overtopped by disk, bisexual; corolla yellow, tubular limb narrowly campanulate, 5-lobed; lobes lanceolate, apex acute. Anthers linear, exserted from corolla, basally obtuse, apex with lanceolate appendages, antheropodium cylindric. Style branches excurved, obtuse or truncate, papillose. Achenes cylindric, glabrous, ribbed. Pappus purple-brown, uniseriate, serrulate, caducous.
  "Reference": "This genus is not only in aspect but also in the head arrangement closely related to *Ligularia*; however, it differs by its petioles winged, expanded and subamplexicaul, but not vaginate at base; capitula discoid, in terminal racemes; and florets 4, all tubular. The genus is also related to *Parasenecio* but differs by its anthers obtuse, not caudate at base; stem leaf base with relict petioles; and basal leaves persistent by anthesis.This genus is not only in aspect but also in the head arrangement closely related to *Ligularia*; however, it differs by its petioles winged, expanded and subamplexicaul, but not vaginate at base; capitula discoid, in terminal racemes; and florets 4, all tubular.

Y. L. Chen in Acta Phytotax. Sin. 34(6): 631. 1966,

多年生草本。根状茎粗壮而短，具多数须根。茎基部覆盖残存的叶柄。叶互生，纸质，基部叶在花期宿存，具长叶柄，长圆状心形或宽卵状心形，基部楔状下延成具翅的叶柄；叶柄基部扩大，半抱茎，但绝无鞘；中部茎叶与下部叶同形，较小，具短柄，叶柄有翅，自中部向基部逐渐扩大成叶状卵形的叶耳，抱茎。头状花序盘状，在茎端排列成总状；花序梗具2 小苞片。总苞圆柱形或窄钟状，直径1.5-2毫米，无外苞片；总苞片1层，4枚，线状披针形，边缘狭干膜质。花序托具小窝孔。小花4，全部管状，明显超出花盘，两性；花冠黄色，管状，檐部窄钟状，5裂，裂片披针形，顶端尖；花药线形，伸出花冠，顶端具披针形附片，基部钝，花药颈部圆柱形；花柱分枝外弯，顶端钝或截形，被乳头状微毛。瘦果圆柱形，无毛，具肋；冠毛1层，紫褐色，具细齿，易折。
<p style='text-indent:28px'>本属无论是在外形或是头状花序排列均与橐吾属 Ligularia Cass.十分相似，但叶柄具翅，基部扩大而半抱茎，绝不形成叶鞘；头状花序盘状，在茎端排列成总状；小花4，全部管状，与后者不难区别。与蟹甲草属 Parasenecio W. W. Smith et Small 较为近缘，但与后者的区别在于花药基部钝，无尾；茎基部常覆盖残存的叶柄；基生叶在花期宿存。

已知仅1种，产陕西和甘肃。
