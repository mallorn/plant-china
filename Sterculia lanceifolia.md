23.**Sterculia lanceifolia** Roxburgh",

> The name *Sterculia lanceifolia* was first published as a nomen nudum in 1814 (Roxburgh, Hort. Bengal. 50. 1814) and is sometimes indicated as having been validated by G. Don (Gen. Hist. 1: 517. 1831, *\"lancaefolia\"*) but Don only listed the name at the end of the account of *Sterculia*, under \"Species the names of which are only known,\" stating \"Tree 30 feet.\" Some would regard this as a validating description.
