4.**Helixanthera sampsonii** (Hance) Danser",

> Recorded hosts include *Camellia* *oleifera*, *Casearia* membranacea, *Diospyros* *morrisiana*, *Litsea* *elongata*, and species of Euphorbiaceae, Lauraceae, and Theaceae.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Danser has indicated by herbarium determinations that this species should be included with the Indian species *Helixanthera* *ligustrina* (Wallich) Danser. The type collection and other material from Hong Kong and Guangdong has a scurfy indumentum and 2-flowered inflorescences, rather similar to the next species, but material from elsewhere in the Flora area has been described as having a stellate indumentum and up to 5-flowered inflorescences. The status of this material needs further investigation.
