## Description
Herbs, annual, biennial, or perennial, sometimes subshrubs, often rosulate, with a taproot. Stems usually leafy. Leaves undivided or pinnately lobed; stem leaves often clasping. Capitula with 5-20 florets. Involucres narrowly cylindric. Phyllaries with narrow scarious margin; outer phyllaries few, longest ca. 1/4(-1/2) as long as inner ones; inner phyllaries 5 or 8, linear-lanceolate, equal in length. Receptacle naked. Florets yellow. Achene ± fusiform, slightly compressed, with 5 main ribs alternating with 1 or 2 secondary ribs, usually scabrid of antrorse acute papillae especially toward apex, rarely glabrous or muriculate, apex attenuate or with a beak less than 1/5 or to 1/2 of achene length. Pappus white, scabrid, usually ± caducous.

This genus is therefore also treated here as a congener of *Crepidiastrum*, extending its geographical range to C Asia.
