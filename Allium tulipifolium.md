> In FRPS, a broad species concept was adopted, with &lt;I&gt; Allium tulipifolium&lt;/I&gt; and &lt;I&gt; A. roborowskianum&lt;/I&gt; treated as synonyms of &lt;I&gt; A. decipiens&lt;/I&gt; Fischer ex Schultes &amp; J. H. Schultes, under which name all specimens in Chinese herbaria are filed. In the present account, a narrow species concept is adopted, with &lt;I&gt; A. tulipifolium&lt;/I&gt; and &lt;I&gt; A. roborowskianum&lt;/I&gt; treated separately from &lt;I&gt; A. decipiens&lt;/I&gt; which was described from Ukraine and does not occur in China.
