## Description
Herbs, small, free-floating, evergreen, stoloniferous, acaulescent, with spreading feathery roots. Leaves several in a rosette, densely pubescent; petiole very short, almost absent; sheath ligulate, very short, very thin, scarious at base; leaf blade obovate-cuneate to obovate-oblong, somewhat spongy, apex rounded, truncate, or retuse; midrib absent, primary veins subparallel, all arising from base, diverging slightly and running into margin near apex, strongly prominent abaxially, higher order venation reticulate. Inflorescence solitary, very small, much shorter than leaves; peduncle very short, pubescent. Spathe somewhat constricted centrally, pubescent outside, glabrous inside, proximal margins connate with each other and with ovary wall forming tube, free margins between tube and blade folded between stigma and male organs forming a partition between a distal male partial chamber and a proximal female one; limb erect, ovate, expanded, acute-acuminate. Spadix shorter than spathe, mostly adnate to spathe, only apical male zone free; female zone with single gynoecium at base and a thin, green, pouch-shaped flap just below spathe partition; male zone subtended by a thin, marginally lobed, green, annular flap, consisting of a basally naked spadix axis supporting a single whorl of 2-8 flowers, naked axis sometimes extending slightly beyond. Flowers unisexual, naked. Gynoecium obliquely adnate to spadix axis; ovary ovoid, 1-loculed; ovules numerous, orthotropous; placenta broad, apparently parietal, probably morphologically basal; stylar region attenuate, bending inward toward male flowers; stigma disciform-subcapitate, small. Male flower a synandrium consisting of 2 connate stamens; thecae dehiscing by single apical slit. Fruit a thin-walled, utricular, several-seeded, ellipsoid berry, irregularly breaking up and decaying to release seeds. Seed barrel-shaped, ± subtruncate and excavated at apex and base; testa thick, reticulate-alveolate, thicker and with operculum at micropylar end; embryo obovoid to conic; endosperm copious.

水生草本，飘浮。茎上节间十分短缩。叶螺旋状排列，淡绿色，二面密被含少数细胞的细毛；初为圆形或倒卵形，略具柄，后为倒卵状楔形、倒卵状长圆形或近线状长圆形；叶脉7-13-15，纵向，背面强度隆起，近平行；叶鞘托叶状，几从叶的基部与叶分离，极薄，干膜质。芽由叶基背面的旁侧萌发，最初出现干膜质的细小帽状鳞叶，然后伸长为匍匐茎，最后形成新株分离。花序具极短的柄。佛焰苞极小，叶状，白色，内面光滑，外面被毛，中部两侧狭缩，管部卵圆形，边缘合生至中部；檐部卵形，锐尖，近兜状，不等侧地展开。肉穗花序短于佛焰苞，但远远超出管部，背面与佛焰苞合生长达2/3，花单性同序；下部雌花序具单花；上部雄花序有花2-8，无附属器，雄花排列为轮状，花序轴超出轮状雄花序或否，雄花序之下有一扩大的绿色盘状物（由不育合生雄花所组成的轮状花序演化而来），盘下具易于脱落的绿色小鳞片（不育花）。花无花被，雄花有雄蕊2，轮生，雄蕊极短，彼此完全合生成柱；雄蕊柱基部宽，无柄，长卵圆形，顶部稍扁平，花药2室，对生，纵裂。雌花单一，子房卵圆形，斜生于肉穗花序轴上，1室，胚珠多数，直生，无柄，4-6列密集于与肉穗花序轴平行的胎座上。浆果小，卵圆形，种子多数或少数，不规则地断落。种子无柄，圆柱形，基部略狭，先端近截平，中央内凹，外珠被厚，向珠孔大大增厚，形成盖住整个珠孔的外盖，内珠被薄，向上扩大而形成填充珠孔的内盖。胚乳丰富，胚小，倒卵圆形，上部具茎基。
