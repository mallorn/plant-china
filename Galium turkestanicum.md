  "Reference": "*Galium turkestanicum* is included as a dubious species for W China by W. C. Chen (FRPS 71(2): 285. 1999). It belongs to the extremely polymorphic *G. boreale* group of *G.* sect. *Platygalium* s.l. and represents a particularly vigorous taxon with very narrow leaves and lateral leaf veins only weakly developed (Ehrendorfer et al., Fl. Iranica 176: 180. 2005). Pobedimova (loc. cit.) gives its distribution as including the Tien Shan. Therefore, it probably also occurs in NW China, Xinjiang.*Galium turkestanicum* is included as a dubious species for W China by W. C. Chen (FRPS 71(2): 285. 1999).
