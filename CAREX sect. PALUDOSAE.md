## Description
Rhizomes stoloniferous. Leaves with short and transverse septate nodes between veins. Involucral bracts not sheathed or lower involucral bracts shortly sheathed. Spikes unisexual, usually 1-4 spikes male, remaining spikes female, single in an involucral bract sheath; female spikes cylindric or oblong, densely many flowered, shortly pedunculate, upper spikes rather shortly pedunculate or nearly sessile. Female glumes ovate or broadly ovate, usually 3-veined, apex mucronate or aristate. Utricles obliquely patent, ovoid, rarely oblong or lanceolate, slightly inflated trigonous, leathery or corky, glabrous, several veined, rarely veins indistinct, apex attenuate into a short beak, orifice shortly 2-toothed. Nutlets rather loosely enveloped; style strict, base sometimes recurved, not or rarely thickened; stigmas 3.
