1.**Cycas multipinnata** C. J. Chen & S. Y. Yang",

> This and &lt;I&gt;Cycas debaoeusis&lt;/I&gt;, with their 3-pinnate leaves, are the most distinct of all extant cycads. &lt;I&gt;Cycas multipinnata&lt;/I&gt; is also one of the most endangered cycads in China, mainly as a result of over collection by commercial dealers and habitat damage as forests are opened up for farmland. If conservation measures are not taken immediately, the species will most likely become extinct in the wild within the next ten years.
