Leaves opposite, rarely alternate at some nodes; leaf blade ovate to elliptic, papery, rarely leathery, abaxially pubescent with appressed or raised trichomes, veins 3–8(or 9). Inflorescences terminal, compact or loose corymbose or paniculate cymes; bracts linear, minute, rarely branched, caducous prior to anthesis. Flowers often fragrant. Calyx tubular, minutely 4-dentate; teeth inconspicuous to narrowly triangular. Petals white, rarely yellowish white, ovate or oblong. Anthers yellowish white or blue-gray, oblong or oblong-ovate. Ovary 2-loculed; style cylindrical or clavate; stigma capitate, disciform, or punctiform.
