## Description
Subarborescent subtropical to temperate bamboos. Culms 3–8(–13) m tall; internodes grooved above branches, rough, finely striate, waxy; nodes slightly swollen, supra-nodal ridge prominent, wavy. Branch buds on promontory; prophyll keels thickened, prominent, densely pubescent and ciliate. Branches initially 3–6, erect to spreading, terete, basal internodes compressed, lateral branching close to culm. Leaves few, branchlets ramifying extensively. Leaf blade lanceolate, to 32 cm, thick, dark glossy. Inflorescence terminal or lateral. Branches erect to spreading, pubescent, branching subtended by very small remnants of sheaths or rings of hairs, pulvinate.
