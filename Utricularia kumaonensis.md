Annuals, epiphytic, lithophytic, or terrestrial. Rhizoids and stolons capillary, simple. Traps on rhizoids and stolons, stalked, ovoid, ca. 1 mm, mouth lateral; appendage 1, dorsal, flabellate, fringed with multicellular stipitate glands. Leaves few, rosulate at peduncle base, petiolate, glabrous; leaf blade broadly obovate, orbicular, or reniform, 2-6 × 1.5-3 mm, membranous, veins dichotomously branched, base broadly cuneate, margin entire, apex rounded. Inflorescences erect, 2-7 cm, 1-3-flowered, glabrous; peduncle terete, 0.2-0.3 mm thick; scales absent; bracts basisolute, ovate-oblong, ca. 0.5 mm, base truncate, apex obtuse. Pedicel erect at anthesis but decurved in fruit, terete, 2-6 mm, filiform; bracteoles basisolute, similar to bracts. Calyx lower lobe oblong, much smaller than upper lobe, apex truncate and emarginate to erose; upper lobe obcordate, ca. 2 mm, base rounded, apex deeply 2-parted. Corolla white, with a basal yellow spot and mauve lobes on lower lip, 3-5(-7) mm; lower lip suborbicular, 5-lobed, middle lobe much larger than lateral lobes; spur broadly cylindric, ± as long as upper calyx lobe, slightly curved, apex obtuse; palate with a slightly raised rim, fringed with short hairs; upper lip subquadrate, ca. 1/2 as long as upper calyx lobe, apex truncate to obscurely 2-lobed. Filaments ca. 0.5 mm, curved; anther thecae distinct. Ovary globose; style very short; stigma lower lip circular, upper lip nearly obsolete. Capsule obliquely ovoid, 2-2.5 mm, dehiscing by a single longitudinal ventral slit. Seeds few per capsule, ellipsoid, ca. 0.5 mm, with a tuft of hairs at each end, hairs usually longer than body of seed. Fl. Jul-Aug, fr. Aug-Sep.
