## Description
Herbs, annual or perennial, rosulate or not, with rigid 2[-4]-hooked or more rarely simple hairs. Stem solitary, usually branched, rarely stems few, low, and weak. Synflorescence corymbiform but sometimes weakly so. Capitula with usually 20-50 florets. Involucre campanulate to urceolate. Phyllaries ± glabrous or hispid; outer phyllaries in several series, gradually longer centripetally, ± imbricate, mostly 1/2-2/3 as long as inner ones; inner phyllaries ± linear-lanceolate to linear, ± equal in length. Receptacle naked. Florets yellow. Achene ± homomorphic; body fusiform to narrowly ellipsoid, often somewhat curved, with 5 faintly secondarily ribbed main ribs, transversely wrinkled, apically truncate or contracted into a short beak sculptured as body (= cuspis). Pappus white or dirty white, of stiffly fimbriately plumose bristles, often outermost bristles shorter and ± scabrid [in marginal achene sometimes reduced to a minute crownlike structure].
  "Reference": "*Picris* has a primary center of diversity including SW Asia and the Mediterranean region and a secondary center in Australia (S. Holzapfel, Willdenowia 24: 97-218. 1994). In C, E, and S Asia the genus is in urgent need of a modern revision, especially with respect to the complex of *P. hieracioides*, which poses particular problems because of it being anthropogenically spread. For the time being, *P. hieracioides* is treated here, in contrast to S. Kitamura (Acta Phytotax. Geobot. 8: 123-127. 1939; Mem. Coll. Sci. Kyoto Imp. Univ., Ser. B, Biol. 22: 90-98. 1955) and, e.g., Fl. Taiwan (ed. 2, 4: 1032. 1998), in a narrow sense, with *P. japonica* as well as the two taxa endemic to Taiwan kept as separate species. This solution has been chosen for the sake of consistency, because including the Taiwan endemics as subspecies in *P. hieracioides* while keeping *P. japonica* separate, as in FRPS (80(1): 54-55. 1997), would imply an unintended taxonomic decision on the relationships of the Taiwan endemics. Moreover, the actual presence of *P. hieracioides* s.s. in E and S Asia and the delimitation between *P. japonica* and *P. hieracioides* need thorough reassessment, and the currently available distributional data are to be taken with caution.*Picris* has a primary center of diversity including SW Asia and the Mediterranean region and a secondary center in Australia (S.
