15.**Brassaiopsis moumingensis** C. B. Shang",

> The name *Brassaiopsis moumingensis* was intended as a new combination but is in fact the name of a new species. The protologue indicates the type and includes a direct reference to *\"Euaraliopsis moumingensis\"* (Y. R. Ling, Acta Phytotax. Sin. 15(2): 84. 1977), where a Latin description is provided. However, because the genus name *\"Euaraliopsis\"* was not validly published (see comment following genus description above), *\"E. moumingensis\"* was not validly published either.
