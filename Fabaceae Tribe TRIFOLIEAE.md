## Description
Herbs, rarely shrubs. Leaves pinnately or digitately 3-foliolate, rarely 1- or 5-7-foliolate; stipules mostly adnate to petiole, rarely nearly free (*Parochetus*); leaflets estipellate, veins mostly extended to teeth on margin. Inflorescences various, often capitate or spicate racemes, rarely flowers 1-3 axially; bracts present; bracteoles absent. Calyx campanulate, 5-lobed. Corolla papilionaceous. Stamens diadelphous (9+1) or monadelphous; free parts of filaments filiform or dilated upward; anthers dimorphic or monomorphic (*Ononis*). Ovary with 1 to numerous ovules; style glabrous. Legumes various: straight, falcate, spirally coiled, or ovate, included in or exserted from calyx, dehiscing by one or both sutures or indehiscent. Seeds estrophiolate.

1 Anthers dimorphic, alternately dorsifixed or basifixed, either all equal or alternately longer and shorter; perennial herbs or shrubs, usually glandular and villous, sometimes spiny.[*Ononis* 芒柄花属](Ononis.md)
1 Anthers uniform in size and shape, not alternately basifixed and dorsifixed; annual or perennial herbs, not glandular, variably glabrous or hairy, not spiny——(2)
2(1) Petals persisting after flowering; legume included in or slightly exserted from persistent corolla, inflorescence generally an umbel or dense raceme, sometimes headlike; filaments dilated upward.[*Trifolium* 车轴草属](Trifolium.md)
2 Petals deciduous after flowering; legume as long as or longer than calyx; inflorescence various; filaments not dilated upward——(3)
3(2) Keel petals acute; prostrate herbs rooting at the nodes; leaves palmately 3-foliolate; flowers 1-3 in long-pedunculate axillary umbels.[*Parochetus* 紫雀花属](Parochetus.md)
