> Because all the Chinese species in this family are cultivated and are often found naturalized in disturbed habitats, it is difficult to know the true wild distributions.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cannabaceae has sometimes been included in Moraceae or Urticaceae but is now usually recognized as a distinct family. The subfamily Celtidoideae of Ulmaceae could possibly be included within Cannabaceae (see the discussion after the Ulmaceae family description).
