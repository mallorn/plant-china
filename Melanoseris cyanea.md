Lower and middle stem leaves with petiole to 12 cm, narrowly winged, not or rarely very faintly sagittately clasping; leaf blade ovate to triangular, 5-11 × 3.5-8.5 cm, undivided or with 1 pair of ± elliptic lateral lobes, margin coarsely dentate, base of blade or terminal lobe cuneate, truncate, cordate, or hastate, apex acute. Upper stem leaves shortly petiolate to sessile; leaf blade similar to middle stem leaves but smaller, narrowly elliptic, undivided to shallowly pinnatifid.

  "Reference": "Plants with less glandular hairy to almost glabrous branches, as they occur in various species besides strongly glandular plants, were originally described as *Lactuca hastata* and recognized as *Chaetoseris hastata* in FRPS (80(1): 275. 1997) but have been considered as conspecific with *C. cyanea* by most authors, a treatment which is also followed here. Plants from Chongqing earlier described as a separate species, *C. hispida*, were later recognized by its author as conspecific with *C. cyanea*, and the name was sunk in the synonymy of that species.Plants with less glandular hairy to almost glabrous branches, as they occur in various species besides strongly glandular plants, were originally described as *Lactuca hastata* and recognized as *Chaetoseris hastata* in FRPS (80(1): 275. 1997) but have been considered as conspecific with *C. cyanea* by most authors, a treatment which is also followed here.
