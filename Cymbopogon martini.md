> This grass is native to India, but is cultivated elsewhere in the tropics for its oils. Two forms can be distinguished in the field, each with a different oil content, but the habit differences are not evident in herbarium material. The cultivar 'Motia' yields palmerosa oil and 'Sofia' yields ginger-grass oil.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name *\"Cymbopogon lanceifolium* L. Liu\" (Fl. Reipubl. Popularis Sin. 10(2): 194. 1997) was not validly published because no Latin description was provided. It appears to be based on a specimen of *C. martini* with a rather lax panicle.
