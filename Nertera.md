## Description
Herbs, perennial, unarmed, sometimes fetid when bruised, often creeping and rooting at nodes. Raphides present. Leaves opposite, without domatia, marginally usually thickened and sometimes crisped; stipules persistent, interpetiolar and fused to petioles, triangular or bidentate. Inflorescences terminal and/or pseudoaxillary, 1-flowered, sessile or shortly pedunculate, ebracteate or sometimes with small involucre of bracts fused in pairs (i.e., calyculate) or of reduced stipules and leaves. Flowers bisexual, homostylous. Calyx limb truncate, 4-lobed, or reduced. Corolla greenish white, white, or pink, funnelform, glabrous inside; lobes 5, valvate in bud. Stamens 4, inserted near base of corolla tube, exserted; filaments developed; anthers basifixed. Ovary 2- or 4-celled, ovules 1 in each cell on axile placentas; stigmas 2 or 4, linear, exserted. Fruit orange, red, or black, drupaceous, ovoid or globose, fleshy, with calyx limb persistent; pyrenes 2 or 4, 1-celled, each with 1 seed, plano-convex, cartilaginous; seeds medium-sized, ellipsoid to plano-convex; testa membranous; endosperm scanty; cotyledons leaflike; hypocotyl hypogenous.
  "Reference": "Phylogeography of the most widespread species *Nertera granadensis* (as *N. depressa*) was studied by Jakubowksy et al. (Evolution of *Nertera*. Poster presented at XVII IBC. 2005) using molecular data; they concluded that this species originated in New Zealand, where *Nertera* has its center of diversity, and dispersed independently to Australia, the Philippines, then SE Asia and Hawaii, and then Central and South America and eastward. They also suggested that *N. nigricarpa* may be better included within the circumscription *N. granadensis*, although species identity and circumscription were not the primary focus of their work so their sampling many not be adequate to address this. *Nertera nigricarpa* is distinguished primarily by its black rather than red mature fruit and was synonymized with *N. granadensis* by Liu and Yang (Fl. Taiwan, ed. 2, 4: 306. 1998), without comment; however, these species were separated by W. C. Ko in FRPS (71(2): 162-165. 1999). If these populations are treated as conspecific, this represents the only example known in *Nertera* of such fruit color dimorphism, which is known but uncommon in Rubiaceae. *Nertera nigricarpa* is provisionally separated here pending further study.Phylogeography of the most widespread species *Nertera granadensis* (as *N. depressa*) was studied by Jakubowksy et al.
