18.**Sterculia simaoensis** Y. Y. Qian",

> More detailed study could show that *Sterculia simaoensis* is better included within *S. henryi*. It is differentiated by the subcordate base of the leaf blade, the relatively shorter bracteoles, only ca. 1/2 as long as the pedicels, and by the purplish, not yellow-brown, indumentum of the inflorescence.
