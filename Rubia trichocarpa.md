  "Reference": "*Rubia trichocarpa* evidently belongs to *R.* ser. *Cordifoliae*, but no authentic material was available to us. A specimen from Xizang, collected 17 Jul 1973 (PE), fits the above description, with its short hispidulous indumentum extending from stems and leaves to the inflorescence, flowers, and young fruit. It has cymes rather condensed; flowers sessile or on pedicels up to 1.2 mm; and corollas dried purple, ca. 2 mm in diam., campanulate with reflexed petals of ca. 0.8 mm.*Rubia trichocarpa* evidently belongs to *R.* ser. *Cordifoliae*, but no authentic material was available to us.
