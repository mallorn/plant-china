## Description
Trees or shrubs, deciduous. Bark usually gray, smooth or sometimes coarse and deeply furrowed. Twigs with annular stipular scar. Leaves at first distichous, later spirally arranged, folded in bud, erect when young; leaf blade membranous or papery, abaxially grayish green or glaucous and pubescent, margin entire. Flowers terminal, solitary, bisexual, often overtopped by a growing axillary vegetative bud and thus seemingly axillary. Peduncle slender, nodding but pendulous or erect at anthesis. Tepals 9-12, 3 per whorl, usually white, subequal. Stamens red, caducous; filaments flat; connective not exserted, apex obtuse or emarginate; anthers dehiscing introrsely. Gynoecium without a gynophore; carpels few to many, distinct; ovules usually 2 per carpel; styles curved outward, adaxially papillate. Fruit ellipsoid when mature, pendulous; mature carpels distinct, leathery or subwoody, dehiscing along dorsal sutures, persistent on torus, apex shortly beaked.
