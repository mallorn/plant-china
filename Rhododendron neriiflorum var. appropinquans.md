427c.**Rhododendron neriiflorum var. appropinquans** (Tagg & Forrest) W. K. Hu",

> As this taxon has a more westerly distribution than that of typical *Rhododendron neriiflorum*, it should probably be treated at subspecific rank, as subsp. *phaedropum*. Then, if var. *agetum* is to be recognized, it should be placed in subsp. *neriiflorum*.

## Description
Petiole sometimes with glands; leaf blade 8–11 cm.

> Mixed forests, *Pinus* forests; 2100–3600 m. SE Xizang, W Yunnan [Bhutan, NE India, Myanmar].
