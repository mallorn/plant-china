## Description
Annual or perennial herbs, subshrubs, or shrubs, often sometimes spiny, glabrous or hairy; hairs basifixed or symmetrically or asymmetrically bifurcate, white or black, at margins of stipules and bracts often with minute subsessile glands. Leaves paripinnate or imparipinnate or leaflets rarely verticillate; stipules green or membranous, adnate to petiole or free, often vaginate-connate behind stem. Racemes axillary, sessile or pedunculate, loosely or densely few to many flowered. Flowers subsessile or with a distinct pedi-cel; bracteoles sometimes present. Calyx campanulate to tubular, with 5 equal or unequal teeth mostly hairy on inner side, sometimes inflated in fruit. Petals glabrous or more rarely hairy; standard mostly emarginate at apex, more rarely rounded, mostly with a ± distinct claw; wings auriculate at limb base. Stamens diadelphous, rarely monadelphous, with uniform anthers. Ovary sessile or stipi-tate; style below or at capitate stigma rarely hairy or penicillate. Legumes very variable, mostly keeled ventrally and grooved dor-sally, 1-locular, incompletely or completely 2-locular; walls membranous, leathery or rarely hard and legumes then nutlike. Seeds rectangular-reniform, estrophiolate.

约2000多种，分布于北半球、南美洲及非洲，稀见于北美洲和大洋洲。我国有278种、2亚种和35变种2变型，南北各省区均产，但主要分布于中国西藏（喜马拉雅山区）、亚洲中部和东北等地。
<p style='text-indent:28px'>本属全世界共分11亚属，我国有8亚属。其中簇毛亚属 (Subgen. Pogonophace Bunge）主产我国，其余亚属各种均分布在我国及邻近国家。紫云英、糙叶黄耆，背扁黄耆、斜茎黄耆和草木樨状黄耆分布略广，少数为狭域分布。

本属植物主要用于牲畜饲料，其次为药用和绿肥。有些种含生物碱或皂苷，有些种为水土保持和治沙的优良草种，还有少数种为有毒植物，也多为富集硒或碲的醉马植物。
