弯羽鳞毛蕨",
8.**Dryopteris cyclopeltidiformis** C. Christensen Dansk Bot. Ark. 9: 60. 1937.",

> *Dryopteris cyclopeltidiformis* appears quite unusual in the genus as it differs from other species in having nodose setae on the stipe and rachis and sori with peltate paraphyses. The taxonomic position of this species needs further research.
