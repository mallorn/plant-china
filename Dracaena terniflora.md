> There may be a nomenclatural problem with the Chinese plants known under this name. The only locality mentioned in the protologue is Sylhet in Bangladesh. The gathering &lt;I&gt; Wallich 5147A&lt;/I&gt; (BM, K), labeled &lt;I&gt; D. terniflora&lt;/I&gt; and from Sylhet, is original material for the name but clearly belongs to the species traditionally known as &lt;I&gt; D. elliptica&lt;/I&gt;. If one of these specimens were designated as the lectotype of &lt;I&gt; D. terniflora&lt;/I&gt; that name would fall into the synonymy of &lt;I&gt; D. elliptica&lt;/I&gt; leaving the Chinese plants without a name. However, it is possible that these Chinese plants are less robust individuals of &lt;I&gt; D. hokouensis&lt;/I&gt; characterized by smaller stature, simple inflorescence, and shorter pedicels. Further collections are needed to ascertain their true identity.

## Description
Plants subshrubby, less than 1 m tall. Stems somewhat sprawling, simple or few branched; internodes often longer than wide. Leaves spaced along distal part of stem, distinctly petiolate; petiole 3--6 cm, distinctly widened at base to form a persistent sheath normally concealing internode; leaf blade elliptic-lanceolate or elliptic, 20--30 × 6--8 cm. Inflorescence terminal, simple, ca. 15 cm; rachis glabrous. Flowers solitary or in clusters of 2 or 3; pedicel 3--4 mm, articulate above middle. Perianth white, (1.4--)1.8--2.2 cm. Berry globose, 1--1.3 cm in diam., 1--3-seeded. Fr. Aug. 2&lt;I&gt; n&lt;/I&gt; = 80.

> Dense forests; 1000--1100 m. SW Yunnan (Jinghong Xian) [Bangladesh, India, Malaysia, Thailand].
