51.**Daphne pachyphylla** D. Fang",

> *Daphne pachyphylla* is a member of the group of species closely allied to *D. bholua* and *D. papyracea* , including species nos. 44-50 in this treatment. It is known to us only from the protologue, which suggests that it can most easily be distinguished by the brownish undersides of the thickly leathery leaf blades and by the distinctive, ciliate margins and tufted apices of the leaf blades and bracts.
