真麻竹",
2.**Cephalostachyum scandens** Bor",

> Bor described this species from Myanmar (where further gatherings are required). Hsueh and Hui were apparently unaware of Bor's name when they described the same species from Yunnan and coincidentally gave it the same name.

## Description
Culms climbing, 20–30(–50) m, 1–3.5 cm in diam., internodes 50–80(–120) cm, apically brown setose, thickly walled but hollow. Branches many, dominant branch often replacing main culm. Culm sheaths persistent, shorter than internode, base very tough, apex papery, with stiff, dark brown or black, appressed hairs; auricles absent; ligule truncate, ca. 1 mm; blade erect, not articulate with sheath, ciliate. Leaves 4 or 5 per ultimate branch; sheaths glabrous; auricles with setae 5–10 mm; ligule truncate, less than 1 mm; pseudopetiole ca. 5 mm; blade 17–25 × 2–3 mm, apex caudate. Inflorescence capitate, solitary at tip of leafy branch, subtended by several bracts; bracts marginally ciliate, long mucronate or awned. Glumes 2 or 3, long mucronate or awned; lemma similar to glume, margins distally ciliate; lodicules 3, conspicuous; membranous. Stamens 6; filaments long. Ovary broadly globose, stalked; style small. Fl. Mar–Apr.
