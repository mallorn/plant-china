## Description
Plants 5-15 cm tall. Rhizome deep smoke-colored, 1-1.5 mm in diam., with dense dark brown multicellular hairs, with sparse hairy rootlets. Stipes remote, 2-4 cm apart, light brown, 2-8 cm × 0.8-1 mm, glabrous, broadly winged nearly to base. Rachis and costae broadly winged throughout, sometimes slightly crisped, glabrous. Lamina bipinnate to tripinnatifid, broadly lanceolate, 3-10 × 1.5-3 cm, membranous, glabrous; pinnae 10-12 pairs, alternate, sessile, spreading, oblong-ovate, 1-2.5 × 0.5-2 cm, base unequally cuneate, apex obtuse; ultimate segments simple or forked, narrowly linear, 2-3 × 0.6-0.8 mm, with 1(or 2) veinlets, margin entire, apex rounded. Veins dichotomous, dark green-brown, obviously raised on each surface, glabrous. Sori on upper parts of frond, apical on short acroscopic segments; involucres tubular, ca. 1.5 mm, truncate to slightly dilated at mouth, narrowly winged, lobes slightly constricted below base of involucres; receptacles projecting, brown, filiform, ca. 3 mm, straight. 2*n* = 144.
