1.**Spartina alterniflora** Loiseleur",

> *Spartina alterniflora* was first introduced to China from North America in 1979. From eight initial plantings in 1985 it has spread rapidly in suitable habitats along the whole Chinese coast. It is used to protect coastal dykes from tidal erosion and to promote sediment build-up for polder formation. Plantations are also used for pasture and cut for green manure and forage.
