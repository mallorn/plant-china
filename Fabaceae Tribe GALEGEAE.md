> About 24 genera and 2900-3200 species: principally in Asia, Europe, and North America, but extending thinly in mountainous and/or drier places to S Africa, Australia, and temperate South America; 11 genera and 586 species (324 endemic, two introduced) in China.

## Description
Herbs or shrubs, with simple or T-shaped hairs; glands or glandular punctae sometimes present. Leaves epulvinate or pulvinus reduced, imparipinnate or paripinnate, with many opposite to irregularly arranged or rarely conjugate leaflets, rarely 1-3-foliolate; stipules free or adnate to petiole, estipellate. Flowers in axillary racemes, spikes, or rarely solitary. Calyx campanulate to tubular; standard clawed or narrowed to base; wings auriculate; keel blunt to apiculate. Stamens diadelphous, rarely monadelphous; anthers usually uniform, but slightly dimorphic and with confluent thecae in *Glycyrrhiza*. Ovary few to many ovuled (sometimes 1-seeded); style slender, bearded or not, with a terminal or lateral stigma. Legumes compressed, angled or inflated, sometimes with sutured margins intruded or longitudinally septate, occasionally torulose, dehiscent or indehiscent. Seeds oblong-reniform, estrophiolate.
