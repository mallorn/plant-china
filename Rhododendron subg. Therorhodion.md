叶状苞亚属",
9.**Rhododendron subg. Therorhodion** (Maximowicz) Drude",

> Recent evidence from DNA sequencing suggests that this subgenus is basal to the remaining subgenera of *Rhododendron* and supports the maintenance of the genus *Therorhodion* proposed for the three species included within it. It should be noted that the presence of bracteoles on the pedicels is unique in the genus *Rhododendron*.
