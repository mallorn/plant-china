48a.**Poa nepalensis var. nepalensis**",

> *Poa nepalensis* var. *nepalensis* is very variable, and more sensitive analyses might reveal additional taxa, but we were unable to divide the specimens in any meaningful way. This subspecies is much more widespread than was previously understood. The types of *Poa mariesii*, from Jiangsu, and *P. nephelophila*, from Myanmar (with branches nearly smooth throughout), are robust forms.
