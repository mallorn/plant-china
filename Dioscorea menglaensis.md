32.**Dioscorea menglaensis** H. Li",

> This species includes material misidentified as &lt;I&gt; Dioscorea arachidna&lt;/I&gt; Prain &amp; Burkill in earlier accounts, including that in FRPS. True &lt;I&gt; D. arachidna&lt;/I&gt; though sharing the same distinctive rootstock, differs from &lt;I&gt; D. menglaensis&lt;/I&gt; in its much narrower leaflets and lack of prickles, and much more closely resembles members of the &lt;I&gt; D. kamoonensis&lt;/I&gt; complex.

Leaves alternate, palmately 3-foliolate, simple distally on stem; middle leaflet lanceolate or subelliptic, 7--20 × 3--11 cm, pinnately veined, veins white pubescent, base cuneate, margin entire, apex acuminate; lateral leaflets ovate-elliptic, base obliquely cuneate, apex acute.
