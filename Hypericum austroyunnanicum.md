43.**Hypericum austroyunnanicum** L. H. Wu & D. P. Yang",

> In most respects *Hypericum austroyunnanicum* falls within the range of variation of *H. elodeoides*; but, discounting the ternate leaves (a character that is rarely species-specific in the genus), the small flowers with ovate sepals and short styles would seem to distinguish it from that species.
