1.**Cornus subg. Yinquania** (Z. Y. Zhu) Q. Y. Xiang & Boufford",

> *Cornus* subg. *Yinquania* was previously published by Murrell (Syst. Bot. 18: 476. 1993), but the basionym was cited from the pagination of the whole paper in which it was published, not the pagination of the protologue, which is not coextensive. The combination was therefore not validly published under Art. 33.3 and Art. 33 Note 1 of the Saint Louis Code.
