> &lt;I&gt;Argyreia&lt;/I&gt; &lt;I&gt;maymyo&lt;/I&gt; was not recognized in the Fl. Reipubl. Popularis Sin. account. An examination of Chinese material called in that account &lt;I&gt;A.&lt;/I&gt; &lt;I&gt;roxburghii&lt;/I&gt; (Wallich) Arnott var. &lt;I&gt;ampla&lt;/I&gt; (Wallich) C. B. Clarke reveals that &lt;I&gt;A.&lt;/I&gt; &lt;I&gt;maymyo&lt;/I&gt; and &lt;I&gt;A.&lt;/I&gt; &lt;I&gt;mastersii&lt;/I&gt; (Prain) Raizada (as defined here) were included. The two species are readily separated by the ligulate bracts which are lacking in &lt;I&gt;A.&lt;/I&gt; &lt;I&gt;maymyo&lt;/I&gt; and so prominent in &lt;I&gt;A.&lt;/I&gt; &lt;I&gt;mastersii&lt;/I&gt;.
