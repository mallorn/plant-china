## Description
Herbs, perennial or annual, juicy, often glaucous, usually glabrous, sometimes with 1-celled hairs, rarely with crispate hairs. Cotyledons usually 2, but only 1 in most geophytic species. Leaves alternate, rarely opposite or in a basal rosette, compound (simple in *Corydalis ludlowii*). Stipules absent or entire to fimbriate membranous appendages. Inflorescences bracteate, terminal (axillary in *Adlumia*), cymose or racemose. Flowers dimerous, bisymmetric or zygomorphic. Sepals 2, not completely enclosing petals in bud, green or usually petaloid, often slightly peltate, entire or dentate. Petals 4 in 2 dissimilar whorls, pairwise valvate in bud. Androecium of 8 thecae supplied by 6 vascular bundles, organized in 2, 4, or 6 \"stamens\" with rather broad and flat filaments, usually nectariferous at base; anthers opening by slits. Ovule campylotropous, bitegmic, crassinucellate. Fruit syncarpous, bicarpellate, 1- to many seeded. Seeds at dispersal with small embryo and copious endosperm. Base chromosome number = 8 (rarely 7).
