> The present authors have seen no specimens of &lt;I&gt;Parnassia simaoensis&lt;/I&gt;; the above description is based on the protologue, in which it was compared with &lt;I&gt;P. gansuensis&lt;/I&gt;, which differs in having staminodes divided almost to the base.&#x0D;\n&lt;p&gt;&#x0D;\nWU Ding, GAO Lian-MIng, WANG Hong &amp; LI De-zhu (Acta Bot. Yunnan. 26: 628-630. 2004) treat this as a synonym of *Parnassia wightiana* Wallich ex Wight &amp; Arnott.
