65.**Elaeagnus grandifolia** Hayata",

> The apparent earlier homonym *\"Elaeagnus grandifolia\"* (Schlechter in A. Candolle, Prodr. 14: 612. 1857) was not validly published because it was merely cited as a synonym of *E. conferta*, even though it was associated with a potentially validating description.
