Trees, dioecious. Stipules adnate to petiole. Young leaves folded in bud; petiole with stipular scar. Flowers terminal, solitary, sometimes overtopped by a growing axillary vegetative bud and thus seemingly axillary. Spathaceous bract 1, just basal to tepals. Tepals 6 or 7, 3 per whorl, subequal. Male flower: stamen connective exserted and forming a mucro; anthers dehiscing introrsely. Female flower: gynoecium sessile; carpels 6-15, connate; ovules 2 per carpel. Mature carpels woody, dehiscing along dorsal sutures. Seeds 1 or 2 per carpel, pendulous on an elongated filiform and elastic pseudofuniculus.
