> *Polystichum cavernicola* and *P. speluncicola* share similar stature, but they can be easily distinguished from each other. *Polystichum cavernicola* has narrow-type microscales on the abaxial laminar surface, its pinnae are papery and have rounded acroscopic bases, and the broadest part of the lamina is located medially, whereas *P. speluncicola* has broad-type microscales on the abaxial laminar surface, its pinnae are nearly leathery and have auriculate acroscopic bases, and the broadest part of the lamina is located above the midpoint.

## Description
Plants evergreen. Rhizome ascending, 0.4-0.8 cm, densely covered with scales; scales brown, linear or subulate, 1-1.3 mm; roots brown when dry, up to 9 cm, 0.2-0.5 mm in diam. Fronds 3-7 per rhizome, (4-)6-10 cm; stipe green, 1-2.5(-4.5) cm, 0.2-0.9 mm in diam. at midpoint; basal stipe scales brown, dull, lanceolate, 3-4.5 × 0.4-0.9 mm, papery, margins with few cilia, apices acuminate or caudate; distal stipe scales similar but narrower, varying in size, brown, dull, lanceolate with dilated bases, papery, margins regularly shortly ciliate, apices caudate. Lamina 1-pinnate, shiny adaxially, oblanceolate, 4.2-9.4 × 1.1-1.4 cm at midpoint, 1.2-1.7 cm wide at broadest part, contracted toward base, acute; rachis 0.3-1 mm in diam. at midpoint, without proliferous bulbils; scales of rachis brown, dull, subulate with dilated bases, 1.6-3.6 × 0.3-0.6 mm at base, varying in size, papery, margins regularly shortly ciliate, apices caudate. Pinnae 10-20 pairs, approximate, ascendant, basal two pairs 5-8 mm apart, basal pinnae deltoid-ovate, median pairs 3.7-6.2 × 2.5-5 mm, largest pairs 4-7 × 2.6-5.3 mm and located slightly above middle of lamina, alternate, oblong, shortly stalked with stalks 0.2-0.5 mm, acroscopic base slightly auriculate, basiscopic base straight and often forming a 75°-120° angle with rachis, apices obtuse, acroscopic margin repand; abaxially scaly, adaxially glabrous; microscales on abaxial surface subulate without dilated base (narrow-type microscales), (0.3-)0.5-1.8 mm, base ca. 0.1 mm wide, with few tortuous cilia on margin of base; frond texture papery; venation pinnate; midrib slightly raised abaxially, flat adaxially; lateral veins free, 4 or 5 pairs from midrib per pinna, nearly opposite; each lateral vein further dichotomous, slightly raised and distinct abaxially, indistinct adaxially. Sori terminal on veins of distal pinnae, (1-) 4-8 per fertile pinna, close to pinna margin, center of sorus 1-1.6 mm from pinna margin; indusia brown, ca. 0.9 mm in diam., fimbriate. Spores circular in polar view, elliptic in equatorial view, dark brown when fresh, ca. 39.1 × 40.6 µm (polar axis × equatorial axis): perispore sculpturing verrucate.
