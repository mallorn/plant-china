## Description
Herbs, perennial, erect, or subshrubs, forming loose cushions from a massive woody rootstock; stems to 0.3 m, quadrangular, glabrous or mostly with ± dense hirtellous indumentum, on angles shortly aculeolate and hispidulous with partly hooked trichomes, lower nodes usually shortly sheathed with membranous bases of old leaves. Leaves opposite and with interpetiolar and ± leaflike stipules in whorls of 4(-6), sessile or subsessile; blade drying leathery, broadly to narrowly ovate, elliptic, elliptic-oblong, or lanceolate, 1-3 × 0.3-1.5 cm, both surfaces hirtellous to ± glabrous, base acute to obtuse, margins retrorsely aculeolate, toward acute and often cuspidate apex usually antrorsely aculeolate; principal vein 1, sometimes with 2 weak lateral veins. Inflorescences leafy and bracteose, with axillary and terminal, 1- to few-flowered cymes; axes mostly glabrous; pedicels (2-)4-6(-14) mm. Ovary 0.8-1.2 mm, sometimes hirtellous. Corolla yellow, rotate, 5-8 mm in diam., outside sometimes scaberulous; fused base ca. 0.5 mm; lobes lanceolate or lanceolate-ovate, 2-2.5 mm, acuminate. Mericarp berry 3-4 mm in diam. Fl. Jun, fr. Aug.
  "Reference": "*Rubia tibetica* is a relatively widespread SW to C Asiatic and typically montane to alpine pioneer species. It was illustrated by Deb and Malick (Bull. Bot. Surv. India 10(1): 4, f. 3. 1968), who lectotypified its name with a specimen from \"Tibet\" (i.e., Xinjiang). The species is notable for its shoot morphology: the well-developed vegetative leaves of lower stem nodes often appear in a 4-verticillate arrangement with ± leaflike stipules, whereas the basalmost first leaves produced by the stems and also the leaves of reproductive nodes are generally paired and exhibit typical interpetiolar stipules.*Rubia tibetica* is a relatively widespread SW to C Asiatic and typically montane to alpine pioneer species.
