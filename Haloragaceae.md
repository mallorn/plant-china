## Description
Herbs perennial, rarely annual, aquatic or terrestrial, monoecious or dioecious. Stem creeping, ascending or erect, often rooting at lower nodes. Leaves estipulate, 2-4-whorled, decussate, or alternate, in terrestrial species always simple, in aquatic submersed species always pectinately lobed. Inflorescence an indeterminate or determinate spike of 1-5-flowered dichasia borne in axils of leaflike primary bracts; occasional lateral inflorescences simpler. Flowers minute, actinomorphic, epigynous, protandrous, anemophilous or entomophilous, bisexual or unisexual. Sepals (2-)4, but absent in female flowers of some *Myriophyllum*, mostly persistent. Petals alternisepalous, (2-)4, absent in female flowers of some *Myriophyllum*, imbricate, longer than sepals, often deciduous with stamens. Stamens 1 or 2 × as many as sepals; filaments short, slender; anthers basifixed, mostly oblong or linear, 4-loculed, dehiscing by slits, antisepalous anthers sometimes somewhat longer than antipetalous ones; pollen grains shedding at 3-celled stage. Ovary inferior, 1(or 2)- or 4-celled, septa solid or practically absent (present only at base and apex of ovary); styles as many (rarely half as many) as sepals, alternisepalous, free, mostly short, grading into globose or subulate stigmas, spreading in fruit; stigmatic papillae hairlike; ovules as many as styles, rarely 1, apical, pendulous, anatropous. Fruit nutlike or a drupe, variously ornamented with wings, ribs, and tubercles, indehiscent and 1-seeded or breaking up into (2-)4 1-seeded mericarps; pericarp membranous or endocarp woody; exocarp membranous or swollen and spongy. Seeds with thin testa; embryo cylindric, surrounded by thick, white albumen.
  "Statistics": "About eight genera and ca. 100 species: mainly S hemisphere, particularly Australia, but *Myriophyllum* cosmopolitan and *Proserpinaca* Linnaeus confined to the N hemisphere; two genera and 13 species (one endemic, one introduced) in China.
  "keylist": "
1 Herbs terrestrial; all flowers with petals; fruit 1-loculed (septa almost absent), 1-seeded; leaves opposite or alternate, simple, margin entire to crenate-serrate.[*Gonocarpus* 小二仙草属](Gonocarpus.md)
1 Herbs aquatic (in China); at least female flowers lacking petals or inconspicuous; fruit splitting at maturity into (2-)4 1-seeded mericarps; leaves whorled, at least the lower (submersed) ones pinnately divided.[*Myriophyllum* 狐尾藻属",](Myriophyllum.md)
