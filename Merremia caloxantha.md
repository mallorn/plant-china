> Known only from the type collection, made by George Forrest in 1905 in the valley of the Mekong at &amp;quot;the crossing of the Teng-yueh and Dalifu road.&amp;quot; On first sight, the deeply trilobate leaves of &lt;I&gt;Merremia&lt;/I&gt; &lt;I&gt;caloxantha&lt;/I&gt; suggest &lt;I&gt;M.&lt;/I&gt; &lt;I&gt;gemella&lt;/I&gt; and &lt;I&gt;M.&lt;/I&gt; &lt;I&gt;hederacea&lt;/I&gt; of sect. &lt;I&gt;Merremia&lt;/I&gt;. However, the anthers that remain straight at dehiscence, the much larger corollas, and the corolla pubescence confined to the apex of the weakly delineated midpetaline bands indicate that this species may belong to sect. &lt;I&gt;Xanthips&lt;/I&gt;. Further collections are needed to elucidate its relationships.
