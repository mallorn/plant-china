> The development and position of the awn are variable in this species. It is usually bent and exserted from the spikelet, but may be shorter and straight. It may arise from the middle to the upper quarter of the lemma back. Occasionally, awnless spikelets may occur in a panicle where most spikelets are awned. The distinction from *Agrostis infirma* is based mainly on the presence of awns, coupled with slightly longer paleas and anthers.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Agrostis sozanensis* is very close to *A. canina* Linnaeus. *Agrostis canina* is distinguished by the presence of creeping surface stolons, an awn arising from the lower part of the lemma back, and anthers 1–1.5 mm.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name *Agrostis perennans* (Walter) Tuckerman has been misapplied to *A. sozanensis*. *Agrostis sozanensis* and *A. transmorrisonensis* were published simultaneously, but *A. sozanensis* has priority when they are regarded as synonyms, since *A. sozanensis* was chosen first, by Koyama (Grasses Japan Neighboring Regions, 485. 1987). The identity of the taxon named *A. transmorrisonensis* var. *kunyushanensis* F. Z. Li (Bull. Bot. Res., Harbin 11(2): 28. 1991), described from Shandong (Kunyu Shan), is uncertain. The type has not been seen.
