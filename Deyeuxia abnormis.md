> This grass lies on the boundary between *Agrostis* and *Deyeuxia*. It has an open panicle of small spikelets as in *Agrostis*, but a bearded callus and rachilla extension as in *Deyeuxia*. It is sometimes known as *A. zenkeri* Trinius (*Calamagrostis zenkeri* (Trinius) Davidse; *D. zenkeri* (Trinius) Veldkamp), a name which probably applies only to a grass from S India. *Deyeuxia abnormis* is very similar to *D. petelotii*, with which it is often confused, but is more robust with a laxer, spreading habit and a larger, more branched panicle. Other differences are given in the key.

Panicle effuse, 8–30 cm; branches loosely spreading, secondary and tertiary branches well developed. Spikelets 2.5–3.5 mm, green or purplish; glumes lanceolate, equaling or slightly exceeding floret, lower glume 2.6–3.4 mm, upper glume 2.5–3.1 mm, keel scabrid above middle, apex acuminate; callus hairs 1/3–1/2 length of lemma; lemma slightly shorter than or subequaling glumes, apex narrowly obtuse, awnless; palea 2/3 as long as lemma; rachilla penicillate, including hairs 1.8–2.6 mm. Anthers ca. 0.5 mm. Fl. and fr. Nov.
