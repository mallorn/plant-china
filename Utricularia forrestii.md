Traps on rhizoids and stolons, stalked, ovoid, ca. 1 mm, mouth lateral; appendage 1, dorsal, broadly flabellate, fringed with multicellular stipitate glands. Leaves few, from a short vertical stem between tuber and peduncle base, glabrous; leaf blade broadly obovate, orbicular, or reniform, 4-8 × 1-3 mm, membranous, veins dichotomously branched, base broadly cuneate to subcordate, margin entire, apex rounded. Inflorescences erect, 2-4 cm, 1- or 2-flowered, glabrous; peduncle terete, 0.2-0.3 mm thick; scales absent; bracts basisolute, narrowly ovate, ca. 1 mm, base truncate, apex subacute. Pedicel spreading, 2-8 mm, filiform, dorsiventrally compressed; bracteoles basisolute, similar to bracts. Calyx lobes glabrous; lower lobe oblong to obovate, much smaller than upper lobe, apex emarginate; upper lobe orbicular to broadly transversely elliptic, 2-3 mm, apex emarginate. Corolla mauve to violet, 1.2-1.5 cm; lower lip suborbicular, apex 3-lobed ± to middle, lobes retuse to shortly 2-cleft; spur filiform, 0.9-1.5 cm, much longer than corolla lower lip, curved; palate with a slightly raised rim fringed with hairs; upper lip suborbicular, shorter than upper calyx lobe, apex shortly 2-lobed. Filaments ca. 0.5 mm, curved; anther thecae ± distinct. Ovary ovoid; style very short; stigma lower lip suborbicular, upper lip obsolete. Capsule globose, ca. 2 mm, with a ventral keel, dehiscing by a single longitudinal ventral slit.
