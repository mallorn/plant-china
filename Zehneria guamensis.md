## Description
Plants scandent. Stems and branches slender, elongate, sulcate-angular, glabrous or rarely puberulent. Tendrils filiform, simple. Petiole slender, 1.5-5 cm; leaf blade abaxially pale green, adaxially deep green, broadly ovate, 4-8 × 4-8 cm, membranous, scabrous, basal sinus semicircular, rarely hastate, undivided or somewhat 3-5-lobed, margin irregularly denticulate or crenate-dentate, apex acute and shortly mucronate or shortly acuminate. Plants dioecious. Male peduncle slender, 1.5-5 cm, apex 10-30-flowered; pedicels spreading, 3-6 mm; calyx tube broadly campanulate, ca. 3 mm, base acute; segments subulate, ca. 0.5 mm; corolla pale yellow, puberulent; segments ovate, ca. 2.5 mm, 3-veined, acute; filaments short, ca. 1 mm, puberulent; anthers ovoid, 0.8-1 mm. Female flowers solitary or sometimes in few-flowered fascicle; pedicels 1-1.5 cm; ovary oblong. Fruit purplish black when ripe, baccate, ovate-oblong, 1-1.5(-3) cm × 7-10 mm, smooth, glabrous, both ends obtuse. Seeds gray-white, ovate-oblong, 2-3 × ca. 2 mm, base slightly attenuate, marginate. Fl. and fr. Mar-Dec.
