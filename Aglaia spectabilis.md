> *\"Amoora stellatosquamosa\"* (C. Y. Wu &amp; H. Li in C. Y. Wu, Fl. Yunnan. 1: 233. 1977) belongs here but was not validly published because two gatherings were indicated as types (*Vienna Code*, Art. 37.2).&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Aglaia dasyclada* is based on a mixture of *A. spectabilis* and *Dysoxylum hongkongense*. It is treated here as a synonym of *A. spectabilis* because the holotype (in IBSC) belongs to *A. spectabilis*.
