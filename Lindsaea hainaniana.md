5.**Lindsaea hainaniana** (K. U. Kramer) Lehtonen & Tuomisto Bot. J. Linn. Soc. 163: 339. 2010.",

> *Lindsaea hainaniana *is morphologically very similar to *L. lobata* var. *lobata*, differing only in the upper pinnules being gradually reduced in *L. lobata* var. *lobata* but ± suddenly reduced in *L. hainaniana*. A recent molecular analysis (Lehtonen et al., Bot. J. Linn. Soc. 163: 305-359. 2010) found, however, that *L. lobata* in the traditional sense was polyphyletic and this resulted in the recognition of the variety at the species level. *Lindsaea hainaniana* also resembles *L. cultrata*, from which it mainly differs in having wider rhizome scales and upper margins of the pinnae more deeply lobed.

## Description
Rhizomes shortly creeping, sparsely scaly; scales slightly spreading, brown, 2 or 3 cells wide at base and acicular at apex. Fronds approximate; stipe stramineous or sometimes brown, 10-25 cm, quadrangular; lamina 20-30 × 10-15 cm, herbaceous, 2-pinnate, consisting of a long terminal pinna and 1 or 2(or 3) pairs of short lateral pinnae, or sometimes without lateral pinnae, linear when 1-pinnate or trifurcate to ovate when 2-pinnate; pinnae linear, lateral pinnae 0-2(or 3) pairs, with 35-40 pairs of pinnules on terminal or central pinnae, 15-25(-35) pairs on lateral pinnae, pinnules not reduced toward base but gradually becoming smaller toward apex, dimidiate and oblong, lobed on upper margin, incisions reaching to 1/3-1/2 pinnule width, apex rounded, ultimate lobes convex at apex; veins anastomosing, evident on both surfaces. Sori marginal, terminal on 2 to many united veins; indusia linear, interrupted. 2*n* = 94*.

> ● Terrestrial, forests; 700-1200 m. Hainan.
