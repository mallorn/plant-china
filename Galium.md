## Description
Subshrubs to perennial or annual herbs. Stems often weak and clambering, often notably prickly or \"sticky\" (i.e., retrorsely aculeolate, \"velcro-like\"). Raphides present. Leaves opposite, mostly with leaflike stipules in whorls of 4, 6, or more, usually sessile or occasionally petiolate, without domatia, abaxial epidermis sometimes punctate- to striate-glandular, mostly with 1 main nerve, occasionally triplinerved or palmately veined; stipules interpetiolar and usually leaflike, sometimes reduced. Inflorescences mostly terminal and axillary (sometimes only axillary), thyrsoid to paniculiform or subcapitate, cymes several to many flowered or infrequently reduced to 1 flower, pedunculate to sessile, bracteate or bracts reduced especially on higher order axes [or bracts sometimes leaflike and involucral], bracteoles at pedicels lacking. Flowers mostly bisexual and monomorphic, hermaphroditic, sometimes unisexual, andromonoecious, occasionally polygamo-dioecious or dioecious, pedicellate to sessile, usually quite small. Calyx with limb nearly always reduced to absent; hypanthium portion fused with ovary. Corolla white, yellow, yellow-green, green, more rarely pink, red, dark red, or purple, rotate to occasionally campanulate or broadly funnelform; tube sometimes so reduced as to give appearance of free petals, glabrous inside; lobes (3 or)4(or occasionally 5), valvate in bud. Stamens (3 or)4(or occasionally 5), inserted on corolla tube near base, exserted; filaments developed to ± reduced; anthers dorsifixed. Inferior ovary 2-celled, ± didymous, ovoid, ellipsoid, or globose, smooth, papillose, tuberculate, or with hooked or rarely straight trichomes, 1 erect and axile ovule in each cell; stigmas 2-lobed, exserted. Fruit on pedicels sometimes elongating during development, green, gray, or infrequently white (to red, orange, or black), mostly dry to leathery schizocarps, infrequently spongy, rarely ± fleshy and berrylike, ellipsoid to subglobose; schizocarps separating into 2 indehiscent mericarps, each with 1 seed, subglobose, ellipsoid-oblong, or reniform, smooth and glabrous to tuberculate and/or covered with trichomes often hooked and clinging; seeds small, grooved ventrally (i.e., adaxially); testa membranous; endosperm corneous; embryo curved; cotyledons leaflike; radicle terete, inferior.

属模式：蓬子菜 G. verum Linn.
<p style='text-indent:28px'>约300种，广布于全世界，主产温带地区，热带地区极少。我国有58种、1亚种和38变种，除海南等南海诸岛尚未发现外，全国均有分布，尤以西南和北方为多；其中有15种和1变种，因尚待进一步研究，故没有被编入检索表中，仅附录于后面。

本属有些种类，因猪食后会生病，故有“猪殃殃”之名。
