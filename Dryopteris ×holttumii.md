> *Dryopteris ×holttumii* is known from three counties in Taiwan. It is presumably a hybrid between *D. apiciflora* and *D. maximowicziana* (Holttum &amp; Edwards, loc. cit.: 199, as *Dryopsis maximowicziana*). The latter hypothetical parent was originally not found in Taiwan but is now rediscovered there, although, according to reviewer Ralf Knapp, *Dryopteris ×holttumii* and *D. maximowicziana* have not been observed to occur at the same locations together.
