19.**Tilia jiaodongensis** S. B. Liang

> The very large bracteolate inflorescence of *Tilia jiaodongensis* is unusual and is probably aberrant. The species was not accepted by Pigott. It was originally compared to *T. mongolica* from which it was distinguished by the acute leaf apex and glabrous ovary. The nature of the ovary requires clarification as the fruit is described as hairy.
