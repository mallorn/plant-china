47b.**Poa acroleuca var. ryukyuensis** Koba & Tateoka",

> It is not uncommon to find plants of *Poa acroleuca* in China with glabrous or nearly glabrous lemmas. The range of such plants, recently named from Okinawa as var. *ryukyuensis*, has not yet been fully documented. These can be confused with *P. hisauchii*, except that in that species the panicles are narrow with short, erect or ascending branches, and the anther to lemma length ratio is less than 1:5 (vs. 1:5–2:5); or with *P. nepalensis*, except that in that species all ligules are pilulose and the paleas are pilulose to the apex.

## Description
Lemma surfaces and intermediate veins glabrous or sparsely pubescent.

> Sporadic at low elevations. Guangdong, Shandong, Zhejiang [Japan (Okinawa)].
