Aster velutinosus Ling in Addenda 359.

多年生草本。茎高约50厘米（下部未见到），中部以上细，有细沟，被短毡毛，上部被较长的白色毡毛，有分枝，有较密或上部较疏的叶。下部叶未见到；中部叶长圆披针形，长4-7.5厘米，宽0.9-1.6厘米，基部稍圆形，或近楔形，无柄或急狭成短柄（长1.5毫米），上部渐尖，有细尖头或镰状渐尖，全缘；上部叶卵圆形，长1.5-2.5厘米，宽0.5-0.8厘米；顶部叶极小，顶端钝或尖；全部纸质，上面无毛，稍有光泽，仅基部及沿脉有短柔毛，下面灰绿色，被极密的灰白色短毡毛；中脉及离基三出脉在下面稍凸起，侧脉6-7对，在下面不显明。头状花序2-3个生于枝端，有短梗。总苞近圆锥形，长约4-5毫米；总苞片4-5层，覆瓦状排列，外层卵圆形，长1.5毫米，被密毡毛；内层长圆形，长约4毫米，顶端圆形，稍厚质，边缘稍膜质，下部无毛。舌花未完全发育；管状花花冠上端有腺点。冠毛污白色，约与管状花花冠等长。子房被密毛。花期7-？月。

产于广西。生于山地灌丛中。海拔200米。

此种的茎和叶被灰白色短毡毛，在本属中至为特殊。由总苞的特征来看，此种似可隶属陀螺系。但由未见到发育的头状花序，所以此种的位置尚难确定。
