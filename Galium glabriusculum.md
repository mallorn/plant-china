  "Reference": "*Galium glabriusculum* is a well-documented species of the alpine subgroup (2) within the *G. asperifolium* complex (see under that species and *G. acutum*). It is similar to *G. sungpanense* and *G. baldensiforme* and mainly differs from the former by its narrower and more leathery leaves and from both by the nearly total lack of indumentum.*Galium glabriusculum* is a well-documented species of the alpine subgroup (2) within the *G. asperifolium* complex (see under that species and *G. acutum*).
