12.**Aletris yaanica** G. H. Yang",

> &lt;I&gt; Aletris yaanica&lt;/I&gt; is known only from the type collection. The protologue illustrates a plant at early anthesis which seems very similar to &lt;I&gt; A. pedicellata&lt;/I&gt;. Further gatherings are needed to establish whether or not it is distinct.
