12.**Fargesia frigidis** T. P. Yi",

> The boundaries between this species and the earlier-named *Far-gesia melanostachys*, *Arundinaria forrestii*, and *A. acutissima* require clarification. The types lack sufficient vegetative material for satisfactory comparison without revisiting type localities.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The epithet *frigidis* means \"from cold places,\" whereas the epithet *frigida*, which is sometimes used, implies a subtly different and less appropriate meaning: \"cold bamboo.\"&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The culms are used for weaving and for brooms.

## Description
Rhizome neck 3–7 cm, 1–1.8 cm in diam., internodes 2–5 mm, solid. Culms 1.5–3.5 m, 1–1.7 cm in diam.; internodes terete, 22–24 cm, conspicuously longitudinally ribbed, initially densely white waxy and white-gray setose below nodes, glabrescent, nearly solid; wall 2.5–5.5 mm thick; supra-nodal ridges level; sheath scar very prominent, woody. Branches 4–13 per node, deflexed. Culm sheaths gradually deciduous to persistent, narrowly rounded, 1/5–2/5 as long as internodes, leathery, very sparsely appressed light yellow setulose, upper margins yellow-brown ciliolate initially, longitudinal ribs conspicuous, apex asymmetrical; auricles absent, one shoulder rising to triangular point; oral setae absent; ligule inclined-truncate or truncate, 1–1.5 mm, glabrous, often rising in center; blade readily deciduous, reflexed, triangular to linear-lanceolate, articulating with apex of culm sheath. Leaves 1–4 per ultimate branch, mostly deciduous in winter; sheath glabrous; auricles absent, one shoulder rising to triangular point; oral setae absent or sometimes few; ligule inclined-truncate, ca. 0.4 mm; blade lanceolate, 2.3–5.2 × 0.45–0.7 cm, glabrous, secondary veins 2- or 3-paired, transverse veins distinct, base broadly cuneate, one margin spinescent-serrulate, other margin obscure. Inflorescence unknown. New shoots Aug.
