## Description
Shrubs, sometimes prostrate or cushion-forming, or small trees, usually evergreen, seldom deciduous, sometimes epiphytic. Leaves small to large; leaf blade margin usually entire, sometimes crenulate or revolute; abaxial surface scaly, sometimes also uniformly woolly, or pubescent or strap-shaped-setose along main veins. Inflorescence terminal, 1–28-flowered, or 2- or 3-flowered and axillary, usually umbellate-racemose, shortly racemose or capitate; flowers small to large. Calyx generally short, lobes leaflike or absent, rarely well-developed; corolla funnelform, to campanulate or tubular-campanulate. Stamens (4–)5–10(–25); filaments mostly pubescent towards base, rarely glabrous; ovary 5(–12)-locular, always scaly, sometimes also hairy; style long, slender, straight, curved, or sharply deflexed, glabrous or with scales or shortly pilose at base. Capsule ovoid to cylindric, valves woody, 2–23(–70) mm, scaly or not, sometimes pubescent. Seeds wingless or with a finlike wing.
  "Statistics": "About 170 species: mostly in Asia, especially from the E Himalayas to SW China, a few species in Europe and North America; 153 species (92 endemic) in China.
