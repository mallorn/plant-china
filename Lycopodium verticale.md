2.**Lycopodium verticale** Li Bing Zhang",

> *Lycopodium verticale* is most similar to *L. obscurum* but differs by its lateral branches mostly angled upward and its whole branches forming a terete shape.A similar European species, *Lycopodium juniperoideum* Swartz, does not occur in China. The relationships among *L. juniperoideum*, *L. obscurum*, and *L. verticale* are unclear.Stolons subterranean, slender and creeping, brownish yellow, glabrous or with few leaves; lateral branches ascending, 15-50 cm tall, lower part not branched, distal part forked; branches dense, whole branches forming a terete shape. Leaves spirally arranged, slightly sparse, ascending or nearly spreading, linear-lanceolate, 3-4 × ca. 0.6 mm, leathery, midrib slightly conspicuous, base cuneate, decurrent, sessile, margin entire, apex acuminate, with short acute tip. Strobili solitary, terminal on branchlets, erect, terete, sessile, 2-3 cm × 4-5 mm; sporophylls broadly ovate, ca. 3 × 2 mm, papery, margin membranous, with erose teeth, apex acute. Sporangia borne in axils of sporophylls, enclosed.The treatment of this taxon has been controversial; some treat it as a variety, some as a form (*Lycopodium dendroideum* Michaux f. *strictum* Milde, Fil. Europ. 254. 1867; *L. obscurum* f. *strictum* (Milde) Nakai ex H. Hara), while others do not recognize it at all. Compared with *L. obscurum*, it is smaller with erect branches, and it occurs in different regions. It is better to be treated as a species.Type: China.
