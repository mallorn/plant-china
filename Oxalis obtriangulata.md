> Specimens of *Oxalis griffithii* are often misidentified as this species. Reports of *O. obtriangulata* from Anhui (S. H. Huang et al., Anhui Zhiwuzhi (Fl. Anhui) 3: 218. 1990) and Henan (B. Z. Ding &amp; S. Y. Wang, eds., Henan Zhiwuzhi (Fl. Henan) 2: 404. 1988) are almost certainly *O. griffithii*.

Flowers solitary, nodding; bracts 3-4 mm, almost at base of flowers (1-2.5 cm from fruit due to pedicel extension). Sepals oblong, 7-8 mm, persistent. Petals white, oblong-obovate, ca. 1.6 × 0.8 cm, apex emarginate. Capsule long conical, 3-4 × 0.6-0.8 cm. Seeds ovoid, 1.8-2 × 1-1.5 mm, longitudinally ridged. Fl. and fr. May-Jun.
