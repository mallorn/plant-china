1.**Bruguiera gymnorhiza** (Linnaeus) Savigny",

> *Bruguiera gymnorhiza* and *Ceriops tagal* were originally found among the mangroves of Gaoxiong (Kaohsiung) lagoon, Taiwan. Both species completely disappeared after 12 years (1956-1968) of expansion and second-stage construction of the harbor (1967-1977). The last gathering records indicate that in 1959 only 22 individuals of *B. gymnorhiza* and one individual of *C. tagal* remained in the lagoon (C. F. Hsieh, pers. comm.). According to C.-I Peng (pers. comm.), *B. gymnorhiza* disappeared from Taiwan in the 1960s.
