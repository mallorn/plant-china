泰山苋",
8.**Amaranthus taishanensis** F. Z. Li & C. K. Ni",

> Li et al. (Acta Phytotax. Sin. 40: 383–384. 2002) believed this species to be conspecific with *Amaranthus* *polygonoides* Linnaeus, a North American species. However, one of us (Clemants) notes that further study might ally *A*. *taishanensis* with *A*. *blitum*, from which it seems to differ only by having five sepals. Wu Zhengyi (editor’s note) agrees with Clemants.
