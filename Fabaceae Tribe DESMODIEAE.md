> About 30 genera and 520-530 species: distributed in tropical, subtropical, and warm-temperate regions, but extending into the cool-temperate and sub-boreal regions of E Asia and North America; 18 genera and 139 species (42 endemic, four introduced) in China.


## Description
Herbs or shrubs, rarely trees or twining. Leaves pinnately 3(-9)-foliolate or 1-foliolate; stipules mostly striate; stipels present or sometimes absent. Flowers in terminal or axillary racemes or arranged into a panicle, rarely an umbel or fascicle. Calyx 4- or 5-toothed or 2-lipped. Wings equal to or exceeding keel and often adherent to it near base. Vexillary filament free or connate with others, sometimes forming a closed tube; anthers uniform. Legumes transversely jointed, sometimes of only 1 article, or rarely 2-valved. Seeds without a strophiole, rarely arillate.
