## Description
Shrubs, 0.75-1.75 m tall; stems densely villous to villosulous. Petiole 1-5 cm, densely villous; leaf blade drying papery or membranous, dark reddish brown, elliptic, elliptic-obovate, or elliptic-oblong, 8-23 × 3-11 cm, moderately to densely and similarly strigose to hirsute on both surfaces, base acute or obtuse to rounded, margins flat and ciliate, apex acute to shortly acuminate with tip to 1 cm and sometimes curved; secondary veins 5-15 pairs, not forming a submarginal vein, apparently without domatia; stipules caducous to tardily deciduous, ovate-triangular, interpetiolar, 15-25 mm, densely hirsute to villosulous, 2-lobed for ca. 1/2, lobes narrowly triangular, acuminate to caudate. Inflorescences terminal becoming pseudoaxillary, congested-cymose to subcapitate, densely hirsute or villous, pedunculate; peduncle 3-6.5 cm; branched portion pyramidal to subglobose, 2-3.5 × 2-5 cm; bracts linear-lanceolate, 4-10 mm, ciliate, acuminate. Flowers subsessile. Calyx glabrescent to sparsely villosulous; hypanthium portion obconic, ca. 1 mm; limb 2.5-3.5 mm, lobed for ca. 2/3; lobes narrowly triangular to linear-lanceolate. Corolla in bud funnelform, outside villosulous, to 4 mm. Drupes red, oblong-ellipsoid, 8-10 × 4-5 mm, sparsely villosulous to glabrescent; pyrenes 3- or 4-ribbed. Fl. Jul, fr. Aug-Dec.
  "Reference": "The protologue described the inflorescences as sometimes axillary, but this appears to be a description of the position separated here as pseudoaxillary. W. C. Chen (in FRPS 71(2): 59. 1999) described the petioles as becoming glabrescent with age and the secondary leaf veins as impressed above, but these conditions have not been seen on any of the specimens studied.The protologue described the inflorescences as sometimes axillary, but this appears to be a description of the position separated here as pseudoaxillary.
