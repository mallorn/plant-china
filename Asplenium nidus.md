> *Asplenium setoi* N. Murakami &amp; Serizawa, recently described from Japan, might be present at low elevations in China (Taiwan); typical specimens can be distinguished from *A. nidus* by their keeled to boat-shaped midrib. Another species regularly confused with both *A. setoi* and *A. nidus* is the often cultivated *A. australasicum* (J. Smith) Hooker, a South Pacific taxon.*Asplenium nidus* is accepted here in a broad sense and constitutes a species complex (e.g., Murakami et al. in M. Kato, Biol. Biodivers. 53-66. 1999; Yatabe et al., Amer. J. Bot. 88: 1517-1522. 2001). The variability of its frond and perispore morphology (e.g., Wei &amp; Dong, Nordic J. Bot. 30: 90-103. 2012), as well as other phenetic characters, is not well studied in relation to its molecular diversity.Based on their particular venation pattern, taxa resembling *Asplenium nidus* have been recognized as a separate section (*A.* sect. *Thamnopteris* Hooker &amp; Baker), a subgenus (*A.* subg. *Thamnopteris* C. Presl), or as a genus of its own (*Neottopteris* J. Smith; syn. *Thamnopteris* (C. Presl) C. Presl). Plants are often epiphytes with large simple fronds growing in a close spiral and forming the typical bird’s nest. Veins departing from the midrib (rachis) fork anadromously, run almost parallel and straight to the margin where they connect to a common submarginal vein. However, recent molecular studies do not support the separation of this group as a separate genus. The clade consists of 15-30 species, and modern research shows that more taxa may await description. A critical revision of the group is urgently needed. Members occur mainly in rain forests of tropical Asia and the Pacific. A few taxa are widely cultivated as house plants and sold as “bird’s-nest fern.” Many plants in commerce belong to *A. australasicum*, which can be distinguished from true *A. nidus* by its abaxially dark brown carinate midrib.

## Description
Plants 1-1.2 m tall. Rhizome erect, thick and short, woody, apex scaly; scales dark to purplish brown, narrowly triangular to linear-subulate, margin ciliate to fimbriate. Fronds caespitose; stipe pale brown, up to 5 cm, woody, when dry semiterete abaxially, base densely scaly; lamina lanceolate, 90-120 × (8-) 9-15 cm, gradually decurrent on stipe, base cuneate, margin entire, apex acute to acuminate. Midrib raised and semiterete on upper adaxial side but flat abaxially, subglabrous, grayish to pale brown; veinlets simple or forked, parallel and connected at their apex to marginal vein. Fronds papery or thinly leathery, when dry grayish green, glabrous. Sori linear, 3-5 cm, on acroscopic side of veinlets, running from near their base up to 1/2 of their length; basal part of lamina usually sterile; indusia brownish, linear, thickly membranous, entire, persistent. Spores with lophate (costate to cristate) perispore. Plants sexual tetraploid: 2*n* = 144.

Neottopteris salwinensis Ching in Bull. Fan Mem. Inst. Biol. new ser. 1: 304. 1949; Pichi-Sermolli, Ind. Fil. Suppl 4: 203. 1965.

植株高约1-1.1米。根状茎直立，粗短，木质，粗2.5-3厘米，深棕色，先端密被鳞片；鳞片线形，长6-8毫米，向上部卷曲，先端呈纤维状，边缘有几条卷曲的长纤毛，蓬松，膜质，深棕色，有光泽。叶簇生；柄长2-3厘米，粗6-8毫米，暗褐色，木质，干后下面为半圆形隆起，上面有阔纵沟，表面平滑不皱缩，两侧无翅，基部密被线形的深棕色鳞片，向上光滑；叶片阔披针形，长约1米，先端圆形并有一短尖尾，中部最宽处为9-11厘米，向下逐渐变狭而长下延，叶缘全缘并有软骨质的狭边，干后平坦。主脉下面全部隆起为半圆形，上面下部有阔纵沟，向上部隆起，表面平滑不皱缩，棕禾秆色，光滑；小脉两面均隆起，斜展，分叉或单一，密集，平行。叶厚纸质至薄革质，干后褐棕色，两面均无毛。孢子囊群线形，长3-4厘米，生于小脉的上侧，自小脉基部外行达2/3（或稍远），彼此密集，叶片下部通常不育；囊群盖线形，浅棕色，厚膜质，全缘，宿存。

特产于云南西北部（怒江河谷，贡山西北方、福贡、高黎贡山）。附生于密林中树干上，海拔1 750米。

本种形体近于巢蕨 N. nidus (L). J. Sm., 最主要区别点为本种叶片先端圆形，并有一短尖尾。
