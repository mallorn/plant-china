  "Reference": "In an otherwise quite typical specimen of this subspecies (e.g., Sichuan, Lutinghsien Mujiaogou: *T. P. Wang 18-9-1938*, PE) the stipules at the mid-stem region are quite comparable to true leaves, only slightly smaller. This results in a considerable similarity to small plants of *Galium hoffmeisteri* from *G.* sect. *Hylaea*, which differ by their leaves and leaflike stipules in whorls of up to 5 or 6.In an otherwise quite typical specimen of this subspecies (e.g., Sichuan, Lutinghsien Mujiaogou: *T.
