Plants perennial, deciduous, caespitose, 3-8 cm tall. Rhizomes short, erect, with a cluster of persistent stipe bases, sparsely scaly; scales light brown, linear to lanceolate, ca. 2.5 × 0.1-0.6 mm, membranous, sparsely fimbriate; adventitious roots dark brown when dry, to 12 cm, ca. 0.3 mm in diam. Fronds deciduous, 5-10 per rhizome, grayish green when dried; stipe brown-stramineous, not articulate, 0.5-2.2 cm, 0.4-0.6 mm in diam., adaxially canaliculate and green; basal stipe scales light brown, narrowly lanceolate, 1.2-4 × 0.1-0.8 mm, membranous, multicellular, fimbriate, matte; distal stipe scales light brown, narrowly lanceolate, 1.2-3.5 × 0.1-0.7 mm, membranous, multicellular, sparsely fimbriate, matte; lamina 1-pinnate, narrowly elliptic, 2-6 × 0.8-2 cm, slightly contracted toward base, apex obtuse; rachis 0.2-0.5 mm in diam. at midpoint, adaxially sulcate, without proliferous bulbils; rachis scales similar to distal stipe scales; pinnae in 3-8 pairs, herbaceous, lower pinnae ovate, 4-8 × 3-6 mm, shortly stalked to 1 mm, base often shallowly cordate or sometimes rounded, apex obtuse or rounded; middle pinnae longer than lower pinnae but otherwise similar, ovate to oblong, 4-10 × 3-7 mm; terminal pinnae nearly an equilateral triangle, 0.8-1.2 cm, apex obtuse or rounded, with 3 pairs of lobes; lobes of pinnae 3 or 4 pairs, obtusely deltoid, nearly entire to crenate on margins; both surfaces of pinnae densely pubescent, hairs translucent yellowish, 0.53-0.69 mm × 14-22 µm. Veins free, in 4 or 5 pairs from midrib. Sori orbicular, dorsal or subterminal on veinlets, 1-4 per pinna segment; indusia brown, shallowly cup-shaped, inferior, contracted to a jarlike shape when dry, 1-1.2 mm in diam., membranous, often 3-lobed, apices of lobes with multicellular hairs 1.2-1.36 mm × 11-15 µm. Sporangia dehiscing into 4 or 5 portions when mature, each portion ca. 0.45 mm; annuli with 18-20 thickened cells; spores light brown, oblong, with cristate perispore sculp-turing.
