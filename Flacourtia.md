> In Chinese species: plants usually dioecious; stamens (10-)15-30(-50), number apparently variable within each species.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Flacourtia* species are often cultivated and harvested for fruit, medicinal use, or wood.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Male flowers of *Flacourtia* are easily confused with those of *Xylosma*; female flowers of the two genera are easily distinguished by style and stigma morphology, young fruits by style morphology and internal structure.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Flacourtia mollis* can be recognized by its leaf indumentum, and *F. indica* (as defined here) by its leaf size and shape. The remaining three species are much more difficult, at least from herbarium material, as staminate flowers seem to offer no useful characters; leaves on flowering specimens are often young, and therefore, generally small, and in all three species the leaf shape and size is variable, with character states overlapping between the species. *Flacourtia jangomas* usually has ovate to ovate-elliptic or more rarely ovate-lanceolate leaves, and *F. ramontchi* elliptic leaves, but all of these shapes seem to occur also in *F. rukam*. Most flora keys rely heavily on style characters to distinguish species. Staminate herbarium material might easily be misidentified. A molecular study based on fertile material could help resolve this problem.

## Description
Trees or shrubs, dioecious or hermaphroditic, rarely polygamous, usually spiny. Leaves alternate, petiolate; stipules small, early caducous; leaf blade pinnate-veined, sometimes 3-5-veined from base, margin glandular-toothed, rarely entire. Inflorescences axillary, or terminal on abbreviated lateral twigs, usually short, lax, racemose, or in form of small paniculate or umbel-like clusters. Flowers hypogynous, unisexual or bisexual, small; pedicels articulate. Sepals 4-7, imbricate, slightly connate at base, green, small. Petals absent. Disk fleshy, entire or comprised of distinct glands. Staminate flowers: stamens many, exserted, filaments free, filiform; anthers ellipsoid, small, versatile, longitudinally dehiscent, connective not projected beyond thecae; disk extrastaminal; abortive ovary much reduced or absent. Pistillate flowers: disk surrounding base of ovary; ovary superior, globose, ovoid, or bottle-shaped, incompletely 2-8-loculed by false septa; placentas 2-ovuled; styles isomerous with placentas, free or united, columnar; stigmas slightly dilated, flattened, reniform, recurved; staminodes usually absent. Fruit a berrylike indehiscent drupe with pyrenes 2 × as many as styles, globose, in dried material characteristically longitudinally angled, squarish or rectangular in longitudinal cross-section, with flattish apex and base, contracted or not at equator, disk persistent at base, style or stigma remnants persistent at apex. Seeds ellipsoid, compressed.
