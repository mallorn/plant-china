Leaves many, distichous, often oblong, flat, thickly leathery, unequally bilobed, with a sheathing base, and blade jointed to sheath. Inflorescence lateral, relatively long, paniculate, occasionally racemose, laxly many flowered. Flowers resupinate, opening widely, predominantly red or orange, sometimes yellow, flat, medium-sized or large. Sepals and petals free; dorsal sepal and petals similar, spreading; lateral sepals usually broader than dorsal sepal and petals, margins subparallel, undulate. Lip attached to column base, immovable, much smaller than petals and sepals, saccate or spurred, 3-lobed; lateral lobes erect, adaxially with 1 callus at base; mid-lobe often ligulate and recurved, small, with lamellate basal calli; spur conic. Column short and stout, without a foot; rostellar projection short; pollinia 4, in 2 pairs, waxy, reniform, slightly unequal in size, each pair with an elastic thread at base, attached by a common linear stipe to a transversely elliptic viscidium.
