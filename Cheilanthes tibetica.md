> *Pellaea straminea* var. *tibetica* was described based on a specimen from Xizang. It was said to differ from var. *straminea* only in its larger stature (to 22 cm tall) and likely represents plants collected in moister or shadier than usual habitats. The name *Cheilanthes tibetica* is based on the type of *P. straminea* and was published without reference to the existence of the heterotypic infrataxon, *P. straminea* var. *tibetica*.

## Description
Rhizomes erect or ascending, short; scales somewhat bicolorous, with dark brown to black central stripe grading to lighter brown margins, shiny, lanceolate. Fronds clustered, monomorphic. Stipe straw-colored, to 7 cm × ca. 1 mm, grooved adaxially, at least toward tip, brittle, scaly; scales concolorous, brown proximally, grading to light brown below midpoint, also pubescent with sparse to dense, short, mostly bicellular, viscid hairs adaxially. Lamina grayish green when dry, ovate-oblong to ovate-deltoid, (3-)5-8 × 1.5-3 cm, pinnate-pinnatifid, herbaceous to thinly papery, glabrous on both surfaces, apex acute or acuminate; rachis and costae straw-colored, grooved adaxially, with dense, short, viscid hairs adaxially. Pinnae 3-5(-7) pairs, subsessile; basal pair longest, elongate ovate or ovate-deltoid, 1.5-2 × 1-1.4 cm, apex caudate. Segments linear-lanceolate, 6-15 × 1-2 mm, bases adnate to costae, margins entire or somewhat undulate. Sori ± confluent, not interrupted at sinuses or segment tips, occasionally interrupted along lateral margins. False indusia narrow, continuous or occasionally somewhat interrupted, membranous, margins entire.

> On rocks; 3000-4500 m. Gansu (Linxia), S Qinghai (Nangqian), Xinjiang, Xizang [Bhutan].

不同于原变种之点在于植株远较大，高达22厘米，叶轴近光滑，裂片宽达3.5厘米；囊群盖多少断裂。

产我国西藏（拉萨、易贡）。生林下或草地石上，海拔2300-3900米。可能是阴湿生境的一个变型。
