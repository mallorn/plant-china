> ● Seven species: China.

## Description
Herbs, perennial, often rosulate, with rhizomes. Stem leafy or ± leafless. Leaves lyrately pinnate or undivided, leathery. Capitula with 5-30 florets. Involucre ± narrowly cylindric to ± narrowly campanulate. Phyllaries mostly glabrous; outer phyllaries in several series, gradually longer centripetally, often conspicuously imbricate, longest ca. 1/2 as long as inner ones; inner phyllaries 5-14, ± equal in length, ± linear-lanceolate to linear. Receptacle naked. Florets reddish to bluish purple. Achene brown to reddish brown, subcylindric to narrowly ellipsoid, rather weakly compressed, with 5 main ribs and 1 or 2 narrower ribs in between, apex truncate. Pappus brownish, single, of strong scabrid bristles.
  "Reference": "Systematic placement and circumscription of the genus have been revised based on molecular phylogenetic analyses of subtribes Lactucinae and Crepidinae (J. W. Zhang &amp; N. Kilian, in prep.; N. Kilian et al., in prep.). N. Kilian et al. (in V. A. Funk et al., Syst. Evol. Biogeogr. Compositae, 348-350. 2009) placed *Faberia* in subtribe Crepidinae, but now ITS phylogenies show it on a very basal branch in subtribe Lactucinae. Recent additions to the genus by Sennikov (Komarovia 5: 109-110. 2008) are based on a different genus concept and are, as far as relevant for the flora of China, not supported. Karyological studies (Y. Liu, T. Deng &amp; Q. E. Yang, pers. comm.) have revealed that the four species investigated have the unusual basic chromosome number of *x* = 17, perhaps indicating a hybrid origin of this genus.Systematic placement and circumscription of the genus have been revised based on molecular phylogenetic analyses of subtribes Lactucinae and Crepidinae (J.
