6.**Dendrotrophe varians** (Blume) Miquel",

> *Dendrotrophe* *punctata* was described from material with densely punctate stems and leaves, but such gland dots occur sporadically in collections from at least both China and Thailand, and there is no clear division between *D*. *punctata* and the very widespread and variable *D*. *varians*. There are additional probable synonyms based on collections from Indonesia and the Philippines.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plants are used medicinally.

## Description
Woody vines, usually shrubby, 1-8 m tall. Stems darkish black, yellowish green when young, 3-ribbed, twisted, ± smooth, sometimes reddish brown punctate.
