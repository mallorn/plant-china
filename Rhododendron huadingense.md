华顶杜鹃",
492.**Rhododendron huadingense** B. Y. Ding & Y. Y. Fang",

> This species differs from *Rhododendron mariesii* in the gray-tomentose lateral veins on the abaxial surface of the leaves, in the stipitate-glandular pedicels, and in the glabrous ovary and capsule.&#x0D;\n&lt;p&gt;&#x0D;\nAfter publication of the family treatment for the Flora of China, it was found to be necessary to validate the name because two types were cited in the original protologue (Bull. Bot. Res., Harbin 10(1): 31. 1990).
