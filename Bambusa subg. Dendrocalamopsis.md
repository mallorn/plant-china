> The genus *Dendrocalamopsis* was validly published when *D. grandis* was published, as its description satisfies the criteria for a *descriptio generico-specifica* (Stapleton &amp; Xia, Taxon 53: 526–528. 2004).

## Description
Culm internodes usually 30–110 cm; wall usually thin, often less than 8 mm thick, but sometimes to 2 cm thick. Branches usually absent in lower culm, usually subequal. Branchlets of lower branches never specialized into thorns. Culm sheaths thickly papery; auricles absent or small, often narrowly oblong; blade deciduous, narrow, only ca. 1/3 width of sheath apex. Pseudospikelets purple-brown or bronze-colored.
  "Statistics": "Ten species: E and S China, Myanmar (*Bambusa copelandii* Brandis); nine species (all endemic) in China.
