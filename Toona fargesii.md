1.**Toona fargesii** A. Chevalier",

> *Toona fargesii* has been overlooked in most treatments of Chinese *Toona* species. The recognition of it here is largely based on the work of J. M. Edmonds. Chevalier based this species on \"Dode Ms. in Herb. Mus. Paris\" in which it was placed in *Cedrela*. Chevalier correctly placed it in *Toona* and, describing it as *T. fargesii* Bahadur (Monogr. Genus *Toona* (Meliac.) 107. 1988), adopted this species; but, while recognizing that it was a distinct species, he muddled it with *T. sureni*. He cited only three collections. Two were from the N Hemisphere and included the type collection of *T. fargesii* cited by Chevalier from China as well as a second specimen from Assam thought to be conspecific. The third cited specimen, from New Guinea in the S Hemisphere, is conspecific with *T. sureni*. Flowering herbarium material of this species, which is needed for definitive determination, is rare. Although this species could be endemic to China, where it is now known to occur in at least six provinces, there are a number of fruiting specimens collected from Bhutan, NE India, and Myanmar that seem to be conspecific, extending the range of this species westward from S China. They include types of *Cedrela febrifuga* var. *assamensis*, *C. febrifuga* var. *verrucosa*, and *T. microcarpa* var. *sahnii*.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*\"Toona rubriflora\"* (C. J. Tseng, Acta Sci. Nat. Univ. Amoiensis 9: 303. 1962) belongs here but was not validly published because two gatherings were indicated as types (*Vienna Code*, Art. 37.2).
