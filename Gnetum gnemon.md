> No voucher specimens have been seen by the authors but the species is very distinctive: the erect habit, yellow-green dried leaves, and lax male spikes immediately distinguish it from\nall other species in the area, and it is reasonable to accept these determinations. The species is widely cultivated in SE Asia and is to be expected in S China. F. Markgraf (Bull. Jard. Bot.\nBuitenzorg, sér. 3, 10: 436-445. 1930) recognized several infraspecific taxa but the authors prefer not to use any of these without having seen the relevant material.
