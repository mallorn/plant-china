223.**Rhododendron jinchangense** Z. H. Yang",

> This species is said to be allied to *Rhododendron fortunei* but to differ in the elliptic and subleathery leaves, the shorter (1–2 cm) petiole, the racemose inflorescence, and the broadly funnelform corolla. However, the plate accompanying the original description suggests that the corolla is broadly campanulate.
