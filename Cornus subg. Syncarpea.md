> Species delimitation within this subgenus is controversial. Over 15 new taxa have been published since the 1950s. This treatment follows Xiang (Bull. Bot. Res., Harbin 7(2): 33–52. 1987), who recognized 13 subspecies among four species, i.e., *Cornus* *capitata*, *C*. *hongkongensis*, *C*. *kousa*, and *C*. *multinervosa*. However, a preliminary allozyme investigation by Dudley and Santamour (Phytologia 77: 425–430. 1995) suggested that *C*. *capitata* subsp. *capitata* is quite divergent from *C*. *capitata* subsp. *angustata*. Thus, in the present treatment, we recognize *C*. *elliptica* as a species separate from *C*. *capitata*. Further studies are needed to test the various species delimitations in the group.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&lt;p&gt;The wood of members of this subgenus is hard and is used for making tools. The edible, sweet fruit is sold in village markets and is used for making wine. The trees are excellent garden ornamentals because of their showy bracts.

Leaves opposite, petiolate; leaf blade ovate, elliptic, or oblong-lanceolate, leathery or subleathery to papery. Inflorescences cymes, terminal; bracts 4, white or light yellowish. Calyx tubular, slightly to conspicuously 4-lobed. Petals white or yellowish. Filaments slender; anthers yellow, brown, or bluish black, ellipsoid, rarely ovoid-ellipsoid. Ovary 2-loculed; style cylindrical, often ridged and pubescent; stigma truncate to capitate.

  "Statistics": "Five species: from the Himalayas to E Asia; five species (two endemic) in China.
