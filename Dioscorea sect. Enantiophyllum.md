## Description
Rootstock of vertical, usually annual tubers (renewed each year). Stem twining to right. Bulblets present or absent. Leaves opposite or alternate, simple; leaf blade broadly ovate to narrowly oblong, margin entire. Male inflorescences spikes, solitary or clustered, or grouped into axillary or terminal panicles. Flowers solitary, sessile; perianth lobes free, incurved; stamens 6, rarely 3 reduced to staminodes, anthers introrse. Female spike sometimes branched. Capsule not reflexed at maturity, usually wider than long. Seeds inserted near middle of capsule, winged all round.
  "Statistics": "About 120 species or more: mainly in tropical Africa and Asia, none common to both continents; 14 species (five endemic, one introduced) in China.
