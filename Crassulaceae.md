## Description
Herbs, subshrubs, or shrubs. Stems mostly fleshy. Leaves alternate, opposite, or verticillate, usually simple; stipules absent; leaf blade entire or slightly incised, rarely lobed or imparipinnate. Inflorescences terminal or axillary, cymose, corymbiform, spiculate, racemose, paniculate, or sometimes reduced to a solitary flower. Flowers usually bisexual, sometimes unisexual in Rhodiola (when plants dioecious or rarely gynodioecious), actinomorphic, (3 or)4-6(-30)-merous. Sepals almost free or basally connate, persistent. Petals free or connate. Stamens as many as petals in 1 series or 2 × as many in 2 series. Nectar scales at or near base of carpels. Follicles sometimes fewer than sepals, free or basally connate, erect or spreading, membranous or leathery, 1- to many seeded. Seeds small; endosperm scanty or not developed.
  "Statistics": "About 35 genera and over 1500 species: Africa, America, Asia, Europe; 13 genera (two endemic, one introduced) and 233 species (129 endemic, one introduced) in China.

8(7) Plants perennial, usually with several to many flowering stems; basal leaves not in a conspicuous rosette; inflorescence formed from a terminal group of cymes, usually broader than long, sometimes with aditional cymes in axils of distal leaves[Hylotelephium 八宝属](Hylotelephium.md)
8 Plants monocarpic, with a single flowering stem; basal leaves in a somewhat conspicuous rosette, dying when plant flowers; inflorescence with an elongated main axis and numerous lateral cymules, sometimes a true raceme with cymules reduced to single flowe[Orostachys 瓦松属](Orostachys.md)
9(7) Stems dimorphic with usually very stout caudex or rhizome, usually with brown or blackish, membranous, scalelike leaves, sharply differentiated from much more slender, erect or ascending, leafy flowering stems.——(10)
