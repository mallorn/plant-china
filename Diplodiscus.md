> A close morphological relationship between *Diplodiscus*, *Hainania*, and *Pityranthe* has long been recognized, and various pairs of these three genera have been synonymized. Merrill distinguished *Hainania* from *Pityranthe*, represented by a single species endemic to Sri Lanka, on the basis of *Hainania* having more numerous ovules and hairy seeds. *Diplodiscus* was separated from *Hainania* and *Pityranthe* by the fruit, which contains only one (rarely two) glabrous seeds. Kostermans (Reinwardtia 5: 372. 1961), followed by Meijer and Robyns (Rev. Handbook Fl. Ceylon 7: 428-430. 1991), reduced *Pityranthe* to synonymy under *Diplodiscus*, which has priority by about five months. Bayer and Kubitzki (Fam. Gen. Vasc. Pl. 5: 258. 2003) made *Hainania* a synonym of *Pityranthe* and thus also of *Diplodiscus*.
