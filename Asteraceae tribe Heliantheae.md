## Description
Annual or perennial herbs, subshrubs, or shrubs. Rootstock fibrous, tuberous, or woody in form of a xylopodium. Leaves mostly opposite or mostly alternate, rarely whorled, petiolate or sessile, entire, lobed or rarely pinnatisect. Synflorescences of scapose capitula, or capitula arranged in axillary or terminal cymes, corymbs, or panicles, rarely with synflorescences with secondary or tertiary aggregation of capitula. Capitula either heterogamous radiate, heterochromous or homochromous, rarely disciform, or homogamous, discoid, homochromous, florets usually bisexual, rarely unisexual; involucres cylindric to hemispheric or rotate; phyllaries persistent, herbaceous, rarely membranous, 1-6-seriate, when 1-seriate sometimes with oil glands; receptacles usually flat or convex, sometimes hemispheric or conical, usually paleate; paleae usually deciduous, sometimes persistent, distinct or rarely connate, herbaceous to scarious, apices sometimes 3-lobed or -toothed. Ray florets neuter, or female and fertile; lamina entire or 2- or 3-toothed. Disk florets bisexual, fertile or sterile, 4- or 5-lobed; style branches truncate or appendiculate; anther thecae dark or pale, anther tails obtuse and entire, or sagittate, auriculate. Achenes often compressed or angled, usually black or blackish; pappus absent, or usually of (1 or)2(-8) scales and/or awns, sometimes coroniform.
