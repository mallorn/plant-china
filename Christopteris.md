> The genus name is often given as *“Christiopteris,”* but this is not in accordance with the protologue. Fraser-Jenkins (Taxon. Revis. Indian Subcontinental Pteridophytes, 45. 2008) includes *Christopteris* within the following genus, *Selliguea*. It is maintained by Christenhusz et al. (Phytotaxa 19: 52. 2011).
