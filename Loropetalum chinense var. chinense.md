3a.**Loropetalum chinense var. chinense**",

> *Loropetalum indicum* was said to have thick leaves with a 2-layered palisade tissue and well-developed cuticle, whereas L. chinense mostly has a 1-layered palisade tissue and a weaker cuticle, but these differences alone are not sufficient to distinguish species. *Loropetalum subcapitatum* was said to differ from *L. chinense* by its larger, glabrescent leaves, but the paratype of *L. subcapitatum*, Liang 65827 (PE), also has small leaves and the difference does not justify recognition of a separate species. Qian (Acta Bot. Yunnan. 16: 235. 1994) described *Tetrathyrium simaoense* with 5-merous flowers, but both 4-merous and 5-merous flowers coexist in the same inflorescences of both the holotype and an isotype as well as Qian 3288 and Chen &amp; Feng 97040, all from Simao, Yunnan. Other characters, such as habit, leaves, and fruit, are similar in *T. simaoense* and *L. chinense*.
