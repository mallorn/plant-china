> This is a very seldom collected species with a delicate habit and exceptionally small anthers. Its generic position is anomalous, as it lies on the boundaries with both *Agrostis* (small spikelets, no rachilla extension) and *Calamagrostis* (long callus hairs, hyaline lemma). It is retained here in *Deyeuxia* because of its relatively long floret in relation to the glumes and its general similarity to other slender montane species of *Deyeuxia*.

## Description
Perennial, rhizomatous; rhizome very slender.Culms loosely tufted, very slender, ascending, 15–45 cm, ca. 1 mm in diam., 2–3-noded, sparsely leafy. Leaf sheaths scaberulous near blade, otherwise smooth; leaf blades narrowly linear, thin, 2–5 cm, 1.5–2 mm wide, smooth, apex acute; ligule 1.5–2 mm, truncate-lacerate. Panicle narrow, loosely contracted, 2.5–12.5 × 1–2 cm; branches in whorls of 2–5, narrowly ascending to suberect, up to 3 cm, smooth; pedicels capillary. Spikelets 3–4 mm, light brownish purple to grayish; glumes subequal, lanceolate, 1-veined, smooth on keel, apex acuminate; callus hairs equal to or exceeding lemma; lemma 2.2–2.8 mm, hyaline, smooth, apex minutely toothed; awn arising from upper 1/4–1/3 of lemma back, weakly geniculate, 4.5–5 mm; palea slightly shorter than lemma; rachilla extension absent. Anthers ca. 0.5 mm.

> Alpine meadows; 3300–3400 m. Xizang [India (Sikkim)].
