99.**Allium cepiforme** G. Don",

> &lt;I&gt; Allium cepiforme&lt;/I&gt; originated in cultivation, probably as a result of hybridization between &lt;I&gt; A. cepa&lt;/I&gt; and &lt;I&gt; A. fistulosum&lt;/I&gt;.

## Description
Bulb ovoid-globose to ovoid; tunic red-brown to yellowish brown, scarious, entire. Leaves deep green, narrower than those of &lt;I&gt; Allium cepa&lt;/I&gt; and &lt;I&gt; A. fistulosum,&lt;/I&gt; terete, fistulose. Scape usually not developed (plants propagated by bulbs), if developed then fistulose, inflated. Spathe 2- or 3(or 4)-valved. Umbel globose. Pedicels slender, longer than perianth. Perianth white; segments with green midvein, oblong, apex obtuse, sometimes with reflexed point. Filaments subulate, subequal, ca. 2 × as long as perianth segments. 2&lt;I&gt; n&lt;/I&gt; = 16.

> Cultivated. Mostly in E China, also Xinjiang [widely cultivated elsewhere].
