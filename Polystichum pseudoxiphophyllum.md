> *Polystichum pseudoxiphophyllum* is tentatively recognized here pending further study. It is similar to *P. xiphophyllum*. One of us (Barrington) thinks it is more similar to *P. pseudosetosum* and *P. tsus-simense*.

Plants evergreen. Rhizome erect, densely scaly; scales brown or dark brown, narrowly ovate. Fronds 30-60 cm; stipe stramineous, 18-40 cm, 3-4 mm in diam. at base, densely scaly; scales dark brown or blackish brown, linear-lanceolate, margins ciliate, sometimes upper part of stipe glabrous, lower part of stipe with lanceolate scales. Lamina bipinnate, broadly lanceolate to narrowly ovate, 25-50 × 10-14 cm, rounded-cuneate, acuminate; rachis without proliferous bulbils, densely scaly abaxially; scales blackish brown or brown, linear with dilated base, margins ciliate. Pinnae 18-20 pairs, alternate, attached at right angles to rachis or slightly ascendant, shortly stalked, linear-lanceolate, middle pairs 6-10 × 1.2-2 cm, bases obliquely cuneate, acroscopic margins shallowly cordate, basiscopic margins semi-orbicular, pinnate, apices long acuminate. Pinnules 6-12 pairs, alternate, slightly ascendant, lower pairs shortly stalked, obliquely broadly ovate or broadly obovate, lower pairs 6-8 × 4-5 mm, bases obliquely broadly cuneate, acroscopic bases without or only with inconspicuous auricles, margins entire or with few inconspicuous small teeth, apices obtuse, or acute and mucronate; basal acroscopic pinnule largest, often ovate, sometimes acroscopic side pinnatilobate; abaxially with few microscales, microscales yellowish brown, hairlike; frond texture thinly leathery; venation pinnate on pinnules, lateral veins often forked, indistinct on both surfaces or only slightly concave abaxially.
