> This species is sometimes misidentified in Chinese herbaria as *\"Bridelia yunnanensis* Pax &amp; K. Hoffmann,\" a name that was never validly published. W. Y. Chun and C. C. Chang (Fl. Hainanica 2: 143. 1965) recorded this species (as *B. henryana*) for Hainan but it has not been possible to confirm this record. Records of *B. montana* (Roxburgh) Willdenow in Chinese literature (e.g., Fl. Yunnan. 10: 74. 2006; Higher Pl. China 8: 22. 2001) are possibly based on material of this species.
