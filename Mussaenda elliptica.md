## Description
Shrubs, 1-2 m tall; branchlets terete, sparsely strigillose. Leaves opposite; petiole 0.7-1 cm, strigillose to strigose; blade drying thinly papery, elliptic, 6-20 × 3-10 cm, both surfaces glabrous to strigillose at least on veins, base rounded to cuneate, apex acuminate; secondary veins 6 or 7 pairs, tertiary venation apparently reticulate; stipules deciduous, ovate-triangular, ca. 8 mm, sparsely puberulent, deeply 2-lobed, lobes narrowly triangular, acuminate. Inflorescence congested-cymose, ca. 1.5 × 1.5 cm, strigillose or strigose, subsessile to pedunculate; bracts linear-subulate, to 8 mm. Flowers pedicellate, biology not noted. Calyx strigillose; hypanthium portion turbinate, ca. 2 mm; lobes subulate, 6-7 mm, with 2 lobes on 2-5 flowers per inflorescence expanded into white calycophyll, blade broadly ovate, 5-7.5 × 3.5-5 cm, strigillose along veins, base obtuse to truncate, stipe 7-15 mm, apex acute to shortly acuminate. Corolla yellow, salverform, outside strigose; tube ca. 20 mm, densely yellow clavate pubescent inside upper part; lobes triangular-ovate, ca. 3 mm, mucronate with appendage ca. 1 mm. Berry unknown. Fl. May-Jun.
  "Reference": "It is implied in the protologue that the stipules are entire, but on an isotype specimen (*E. H. Wilson 4604,* US - bar code 00137848, Web!) they are deeply bilobed; also the protologue described the inflorescences as pedunculate, but they are subsessile on this isotype. In FRPS (71(1): 302. 1999), the leaves were described as sparsely pubescent and the calyx lobes as 4.5-5.5 mm, but in the protologue they were described as glabrous and 6-7 mm, respectively.It is implied in the protologue that the stipules are entire, but on an isotype specimen (*E.
