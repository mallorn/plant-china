3.**Aucubaceae** J. Agardh",

> *Aucuba*, previously placed in the Cornaceae, has been included in the Garryaceae on the basis of molecular, chemical, and morphological evidence (Bremer et al., Pl. Syst. Evol. 229: 137–169. 2001). *Aucuba* and *Garrya* Douglas ex Lindley, the latter genus from Central America (including the Greater Antilles) and W North America, are sister taxa with high support (Angiosperm Phylogeny Group, Bot. J. Linn. Soc. 141: 399–436. 2003). It is here preferred to treat the two genera in separate families: Aucubaceae and Garryaceae.
