> Although originally described as a variety of &lt;I&gt;Primula nivalis&lt;/I&gt; Pallas and later associated with &lt;I&gt;P.&lt;/I&gt; &lt;I&gt;limbata&lt;/I&gt; I. B. Balfour &amp;amp; Forrest and &lt;I&gt;P.&lt;/I&gt; &lt;I&gt;russeola&lt;/I&gt; I. B. Balfour &amp;amp; Forrest, &lt;I&gt;P.&lt;/I&gt; &lt;I&gt;melanantha&lt;/I&gt; is much closer to &lt;I&gt;P.&lt;/I&gt; &lt;I&gt;purdomii&lt;/I&gt; Craib on account of its habit. It differs from all of the above mentioned species by its pubescent leaves and much smaller flowers.
