## Description
Herbs, perennial, from slender rhizomes. Stems procumbent, ascending or erect, (15-)25-80(-125) cm tall, 4-angled, usually glabrous and smooth (rarely somewhat retrorsely aculeolate), hirtellous at nodes. Leaves in whorls of up to 6(-8), subsessile; blade drying papery, sometimes blackening, narrowly obovate to broadly (ob)lanceolate, (15-)20-35(-45) × (3-)6-12(-16) mm, ± glabrous but with appressed and antrorse microhairs adaxially and antrorse aculei along margins, base acute to cuneate, margin flat to thinly revolute, apex acute or rounded and abruptly mucronate; vein 1. Inflorescences terminal and axillary, with few- to several-flowered cymes at upper 2-4 stem nodes; axes glabrous and smooth; bracts few, narrowly elliptic to narrowly lanceolate, 2-5 mm; pedicels ca. 1.5 mm. Ovary obovoid, ca. 0.5 mm, densely hispidulous with undeveloped trichomes. Corolla white or greenish, rotate, 1.5-2 mm in diam., lobed for 3/4 or more, glabrous; lobes 4, triangular, acute. Mericarps ellipsoid, 1.5-2.5 mm, with dense uncinate trichomes ca. 1 mm, on pedicels elongating up to 10 mm. Fl. and fr. Jul-Sep.

We have seen only two non-flowering specimens from SW China (Guizhou: *Northern Qian [Guizhou] Team 907*, PE; Sichuan: *G. H. Yang 54472*, PE), which apparently belong here. Indications for more northern provinces by W. C. Chen (FRPS 71(2): 232. 1999) have been listed here under *G. trifloriforme* (see there), a taxon not recognized as distinct by W. C. Chen (loc. cit.: 230). Both taxa urgently need more detailed study. *Galium triflorum* is very similar and morphologically subcontinuous with *G. trifloriforme* but differs from it by its more elongate inflorescences, mostly smooth stems, and particularly by its antrorsely aculeolate leaf margins. This latter character clearly places it into *G.* sect. *Hylaea* and into the close neighborhood of *G. hoffmeisteri* on the mainland, *G. echinocarpum* on Taiwan, and *G. nipponicum* in Japan.*Galium triflorum* is obviously rare in China and does not occur in the Himalaya, as already suspected by Pobedimova et al.
