Inflorescences terminal and/or axillary, cymose, few flowered, up to 1 cm; axes glabrous and smooth, somewhat bracteate; pedicels ca. 1 mm. Flowers unknown.

In the protologue similarities with the Taiwanese *G. tarokoense* are suggested. Both species are distantly related, but apparently *G. crassifolium* falls within the morphological amplitude of the polymorphic *G. bungei*. Its distinctness with respect to reduced plants from dry habitats should be checked in the future.We have seen no authentic material of *Galium crassifolium*, but the original description is accompanied by a good drawing.
