> Perhaps var. brevipedicellatum is not worthy of recognition. Measurements from the type specimens of the two varieties indicate that the differences between them, while still diagnostic, are not as large as were quoted in FRPS (57(2): 13. 1994).

## Description
Leaf blade 3–4.5 cm wide. Pedicel 1.3–2 cm; corolla 3–3.5 cm.

> Forests, valleys, roadsides; ca. 2200 m. NW Sichuan.
