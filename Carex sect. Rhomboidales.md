## Description
Culms central or lateral, rarely very short. Involucral bracts shortly bladed and sheathing or leaflike and sheathless. Terminal spike male, cylindric, clavate, or linear; lateral spikes androgynous, usually with a long or short male part at apex, rarely all female. Female glumes ovate, oblong, or ovate-lanceolate, rarely linear-lanceolate, apex mucronate, rounded or acuminate, rarely emarginate. Utricles rhomboid, elliptic, or ovate, subleathery or membranous, glabrous, rarely hirsute, many veined, base gradually attenuate, apex abruptly contracted into a long beak, orifice 2-toothed. Nutlets obovate or ovate, trigonous, with angles constricted at middle, beak erect or curved, annulate or not at orifice; style base thickened or not thickened; stigmas 3.
