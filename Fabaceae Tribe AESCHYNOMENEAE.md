> About 23 genera (*Arthrocarpum* I. B. Balfour and *Pachecoa* Standley &amp; Steyermark have been merged into *Chapmannia* Torrey &amp; A. Gray) and ca. 530 species: tropical, subtropical, and warm-temperate areas; seven genera (three introduced) and 14 species (five introduced) in China.

## Description
Herbs or shrubs, sometimes scandent, rarely small trees, sometimes glandular with pellucid punctate or with tuberculate-based hairs. Leaves pari- or imparipinnate; leaflets usually 5 to many, sometimes 1-4, alternate or opposite; stipules sometimes appen-diculate below point of attachment, sometimes spinescent; stipels usually absent. Inflorescences racemose or sometimes paniculate, fasciculate, or subcymose, or flowers solitary, axillary or terminal; bracts similar to stipules or large and circular, often enclosing flowers and fruit; bracteoles paired. Calyx campanulate with subequal lobes or teeth, or bilabiate. Corolla papilionaceous. Stamens 10, usually monadelphous or diadelphous (5+5); anthers uniform or dimorphic. Legumes usually a loment or lomentaceous (except *Arachis* unjointed and geocarpic), usually straight or slightly curved, or sometimes coiled or plicate, enclosed in calyx. Seeds reni-form; hilum short, lateral.

Recently, all members of Aeschynomeneae have been included in an enlarged Dalbergieae sensu lato (Lavin &amp; Klitgaard in Lewis et al., Legumes World, 307-335. 2005). However, the two elements are so disparate morphologically that a conservative treatment has been adopted here, i.e., maintaining both tribes.The circumscription adopted here follows V. E.
