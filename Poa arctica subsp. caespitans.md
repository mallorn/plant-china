23.**Poa arctica subsp. caespitans** Simmons ex Nannfeldt",

> The only Chinese material seen by the authors is from Jilin (Changbai Shan), and this is tentatively placed within subsp. *caespitans*. The specimens have no evident rhizomes, like subsp. *caespitans*. The rachillas are strongly pilose as in subsp. *lanata* (Scribner &amp; Merrill) Soreng (incl. *Poa malacantha* Komarov), but the leaf blades are too thin and the spikelets too small for that taxon. *Poa arctica* subsp. *arctica* is distinguished by its loose, rhizomatous habit, mostly solitary culms, and generally glabrous rachillas. These gatherings had been identified as *P. shinoana* Ohwi (*P. malacantha* subsp. *shinoana* (Ohwi) T. Koyama; *P. malacantha* var. *shinoana* (Ohwi) Ohwi). FRPS (9(2): 132. 2002) reported *P. tolmatchewii* from Heilongjiang, but we have not seen a voucher specimen. Specimens named as *P. arctica* subsp. *arctica* from Gansu, Hebei, Nei Mongol, Qinghai, and Xinjiang have been redetermined as other species, mostly *P. tangii*. *Poa arctica* subsp. *arctica* is a circumboreal arctic and alpine species, and is known as far south as ca. 50°N in the mountains S of Lake Baikal (but not from Mongolia) and from northernmost Korea (*P. deschampsioides* Ohwi), but there seems to be little or no suitable habitat in adjacent parts of China.

## Description
Perennials, densely tufted, short rhizomatous or not (Chinese plants); shoots extravaginal and some intravaginal. Culms solitary to several (rarely up to 20, Chinese plants), 7.5–60 cm tall, 0.5–2 mm in diam., smooth, glabrous, nodes 1 or 2, none or 1 exserted, uppermost to 1/3 way up, base of culms with sheaths soon withering (in Chinese plants). Leaf sheaths weakly keeled, smooth, glabrous, 2–15 cm, 1.5–5 × as long as blade, uppermost closed for 1/4–1/3 of length; blades flat or folded, papery to thickly papery, 1–6 mm wide, surfaces smooth or sparsely scabrid, of tillers folded, 2–15 cm; ligule 2–4 mm, abaxially smooth or sparsely scabrid, apex obtuse to acute. Panicle open, ovoid to pyramidal, well exserted, 3–10 (–15) × 2–6 cm, internodes 0.8–1.5(–3) cm; branches spreading early, sinuous and flexuous to strict, (1–)2–5 per node, slender to moderately stout, rounded, smooth or distally scabrid, longest 1.5–5 cm with 2–7 spikelets in distal 1/3. Spikelets ovate, strongly purple tinged, 4–5(–5.5) mm, florets (2–)3–4 (–6); vivipary absent (within China); rachilla internodes 0.8–1.2 mm, smooth, glabrous, or short villous (within China); glumes subequal, lanceolate, very thinly papery, 3-veined, weakly keeled, smooth or sparsely scabrid, lower glume (2–)2.5–4.5 mm, upper glume (2.5–)3–5 mm; lemmas lanceolate to broadly lanceolate, 3.5–4.5 mm, margins broadly membranous, apex acute, keel densely long-villous for 3/4 of length, marginal veins to 2/3, intermediate veins prominent, area between veins smooth to moderately bumpy, distally smooth or sparsely scabrid, proximally (sparsely to) densely shortly villous; callus webbed, hairs usually dense, to 1/2 as long as lemma; palea sparsely to moderately pilulose between keels, keels scabrid, medially pilulose. Anthers 1.4–2.5 mm. Fl. and fr. Jul–Aug. 2*n* = 77.

> Wet places along glacial rivers or lakes, alpine meadows, grassy places on rocky slopes; ca. 2100 m. Heilongjiang, Jilin [Russia; Europe (Scandinavia), North America].
