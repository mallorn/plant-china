> Two (to six) species: from E Africa and Madagascar through India to Peninsular Malaysia, northeast to Japan and Korea and southeast to the Solomon Islands; two species in China.First recognized by Kramer (Blumea 15: 560. 1967) as a section within *Lindsaea*, *Osmolindsaea* was recently elevated to a separate genus based on molecular data by Lehtonen et al. (Bot. J. Linn. Soc. 163: 305-359. 2010). *Osmolindsaea*, together with *Nesolindsaea* and *Tapeinidium*, was resolved to be sister to *Lindsaea* s.s. (Lehtonen et al., loc. cit.). The number of species that should be accepted in this genus worldwide is still uncertain, but there are two taxa in China.
