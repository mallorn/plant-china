> Described from Vietnam, this species was first reported from China by Wu (Index Fl. Yunnan. 1: 326. 1984). Gowda also described var. *poilanei* Gowda (J. Arnold Arbor. 32: 320. 1951) from Vietnam; it was distinguished from var. *merrillianum* only by having the leaf blade larger and oblong or elliptic-oblong.
