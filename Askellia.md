## Description
Herbs, perennial, usually rather delicate, with a slender taproot and often with shoot-bearing lateral roots. Stems rather low, slender, often branched from base. Leaves in basal rosette or along stem, usually small, with orbicular to obovate and spatulate blade attenuate into a long petiole-like base, glabrous. Synflorescence mostly with rather few capitula. Capitula erect, with 5-15 florets. Involucre narrowly cylindric. Phyllaries in few series, glabrous [or setulose or arachnoid hairy]; outer phyllaries usually less than 1/4, rarely to 1/3, as long as inner ones; inner phyllaries linear-lanceolate, equal. Receptacle naked. Florets yellow or more rarely pale purplish red. Achene usually pale brown, slenderly cylindric to slenderly fusiform, with 10 thin equal ribs, apically truncate, attenuate, or shortly beaked. Pappus white, of scabrid bristles, usually caducous or persistent.
