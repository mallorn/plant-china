## Description
Herbs, perennial, from thin creeping rhizomes. Stems erect, 20-35 cm tall, with 4 thickened angles, smooth, at nodes glabrous or hispidulous. Leaves in whorls of 4(-6), subsessile, with petiole up to 2 mm; blade drying papery to leathery, elliptic or elliptic-oblong to ovate, (12-)20-25(-28) × (7-)10-11(-15) mm, glabrous or hirtellous to hispidulous along principal veins, ± abruptly narrowed into short petiole, margins antrorsely ciliolate, apex obtuse to subacute; principal veins 3-5, palmate. Inflorescences umbel-like thyrsoid and many-flowered panicles with terminal and lateral cymes from uppermost leaf axils; peduncles smooth and glabrous; bracts narrowly oblanceolate or elliptic to ligulate, 1-3 × 0.5-1.5 mm; pedicels 0.5-1.5 mm. Ovary ellipsoid, ca. 0.8 mm, glabrous. Corolla white, funnelform, with tube ± as long as lobes, 4-5 mm in diam.; lobes 4, elliptic-oblong. Mericarps ovoid, 1.7-2.8 mm, glabrous and smooth. Fl. and fr. Jul-Sep.
  "Reference": "*Galium platygalium* is closely related to *G. maximoviczii* (see there) but has larger flowers and whorls of opposite leaves and leaflike stipules with 4 or more (rarely up to 6) elements. Because of their slightly elongated, fused corolla base, the two species in the older literature were placed into the genus *Asperula*, where they had no other close relatives. In spite of their increase in leaf whorl elements, the two species have been placed by Ehrendorfer et al. (Fl. Iranica 176: 175. 2005) into *G.* sect. *Platygalium* s.l. Though this section normally is characterized by leaf whorls with only up to 4 elements, this placement may be justified because the two species correspond otherwise quite well, as in habit, inflorescences, and leaves (with 3-5 palmate principal veins).*Galium platygalium* is closely related to *G. maximoviczii* (see there) but has larger flowers and whorls of opposite leaves and leaflike stipules with 4 or more (rarely up to 6) elements.
