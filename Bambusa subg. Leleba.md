## Description
Culm internodes mostly shorter than 30 cm; wall to 2 cm thick; branchlets of lower branches never specialized into tough or weak thorns. Branches usually absent toward culm base, usually 3 co-dominant. Culm sheaths thickly papery; auricles large, rounded or irregular, or absent; blade deciduous, broad, base 1/2–3/4 width of sheath apex. Pseudospikelets loose at maturity, with broad florets on short rachilla segments.
  "Statistics": "More than 35 species:widely distributed in tropical and subtropical Asia; widely planted in other parts of the world; 30 species (22 endemic) in China, mainly in the south, some in the southwest.
