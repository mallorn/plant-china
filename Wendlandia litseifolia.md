## Description
Trees, ca. 10 m tall; branches terete to subquadrangular, densely brown hirtellous to glabrescent. Leaves opposite; petiole 0.5-1.2 cm, densely hirtellous to strigillose; blade drying subleathery, obovate, obovate-elliptic, or rarely elliptic, 6.4-11.5 × 3-6.5 cm, adaxially sparsely hispidulous to puberulent with pubescence denser along midrib, abaxially sparsely to moderately strigillose or hirtellous with pubescence denser along veins, base obtuse, apex acute to abruptly and shortly acuminate; secondary veins 6-8 pairs, plane to hardly visible abaxially; stipules generally persistent, pandurate, 3-5 × 1.5-2 mm, densely strigillose, apex suberect to spreading, subrounded. Inflorescences paniculate, 7-10 × 4-5 cm, branched to 2 or 3 orders, dark yellow- to reddish brown tomentose to -hirtellous, pedunculate; peduncle 0.5-0.8 cm; bracts linear to narrowly elliptic, 1-3 mm.
