希萨尔早熟禾",
24.**Poa hissarica** Roshevitz ex Ovczinnikov",

> *Poa hissarica* is possibly endemic to the W slope of the C Asian Republics, but one specimen from Xinjiang (Tian Shan, 2800 m), with very sparse callus web and very sparsely hispid between the lemma veins, is close to this species. Perhaps *P. hissarica* would be better treated as a subspecies of *P. lipskyi*.

## Description
Perennials, densely tufted, with or without short lateral shoots; shoots extravaginal and intravaginal. Culms few to several per tuft, erect or obliquely ascending, (10–)15–40 cm tall, 0.5–0.8 mm in diam., smooth, nodes 2 or 3, 1 or 2 exserted, uppermost to 1/4 way up, base enclosed by persistent pale brown leaf sheaths. Leaf sheaths smooth, glabrous, 3–9 cm, 4–5 × as long as blade, uppermost closed for 1/3–2/3 of length; blades folded with margins inrolled or not, moderately papery to thickly papery, ca. 2 mm wide, abaxially smooth, adaxially smooth or sparsely scabrid, margins scabrid, longest intravaginal ones to 3–8 cm; ligule 1–2 mm, abaxially smooth or sparsely scabrid, margin dentate to lacerate, sometimes ciliolate, apex truncate to obtusely rounded, collars smooth, glabrous. Panicle loosely contracted or open, erect, exserted, (3–) 4–10 × 3–7 cm; branches spreading, straight or slightly flexuous, 2 per node, slender, rounded and smooth throughout or distally slightly angled and pedicels sparsely scabrid, longest (1.2–)2–5 cm with 1–5 spikelets in distal (1/3–)1/2. Spikelets ovate, tinged pale purple, (4–)5–8(–10) mm, florets (2–)3–6; vivipary absent; rachilla internodes 0.8–1.2 mm, smooth, glabrous; glumes unequal to subequal, very thinly papery, shiny, smooth or keel sparsely scabrid distally, lower glume (2–)2.5–3.5 mm, 1- or 3-veined, upper glume 3–4 mm, 3-veined; lemmas ovoid to broadly lanceolate, 3–4.8 mm, intermediate veins indistinct, smooth throughout to sparsely and finely scabrid on and along margins, glabrous throughout, margins broadly membranous, apex obtuse to acute; callus glabrous; palea smooth, glabrous between keels, keels medially scabrid to ciliate, distally scabrid. Anthers ca. 2 mm. Fl. and fr. Jun–Jul.

> Alpine moist rocky grassy slopes; (2800–)3700–4000 m. Xinjiang [Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan].
