## Description
Herbs, evergreen, rarely seasonally dormant, latex-bearing, medium sized to rarely arborescent and gigantic. Stem thick, often hypogeal, sometimes stoloniferous and bulbiferous, epigeal stem usually erect and later decumbent, rather less often elongated and creeping. Leaves few to several in terminal crown, less often scattered, sometimes each subtended by a cataphyll; petiole long [sometimes minutely asperous, minutely puberulent, or glandular], sheath relatively long; leaf blade sometimes pubescent abaxially, juvenile blade peltate, at maturity usually sagittate, less often ± hastate or cordate, but remaining peltate in some species, margin entire or sinuate [or slightly to deeply pinnatifid]; posterior divisions ovate or triangular; basal ribs well developed, wax glands present in axils of primary lateral veins and midrib; primary lateral veins pinnate, forming submarginal collective vein, 1 or 2 closely adjacent marginal veins also present, secondary and tertiary lateral veins arising from primaries at a wide angle, then arching strongly toward leaf margin, sometimes forming interprimary veins, higher order venation reticulate. Inflorescences 1 or 2 to many in each floral sympodium; peduncle usually shorter than petioles. Spathe persistent, erect, convolute, gaping only basally, strongly constricted between tube and blade, rarely not; tube with convolute margins, shorter than limb, ovoid or oblong, persistent and then splitting irregularly in fruit; limb oblong, usually boat-shaped, rarely arching, at anthesis at first erect, then reflexing and later usually deciduous. Spadix sessile, sometimes shortly stipitate, rarely obliquely adnate to spathe, shorter than spathe; female zone conic-cylindric, short, separated from male by a much narrower zone of sterile flowers; male zone usually cylindric; appendix conic to cylindric, with irregular, labyrinthine network of fissures. Flowers unisexual, naked. Pistil ovoid or oblong, 1-loculed or partially 3- or 4-loculed at apex; ovules 6-10, orthotropous, hemiorthotropous, hemianatropous, or anatropous; funicle short; placenta basal; stylar region short; stigma depressed capitate, ± distinctly 3- or 4-lobed. Male flowers 3-12(-36)-androus; stamens connate into obpyramidal, subhexagonal, truncate, rarely linear, synandria; thecae oblong to linear-oblong, lateral, dehiscing by apical pore; synandrodes shallow, obpyramidal, compressed, truncate. Fruit a reddish, ellipsoid or obconic-ellipsoid or subglobose odorless berry, 1-5-seeded; stigma remnants persistent. Seed subglobose to ellipsoid, rather large; testa thickish, smooth or scabrous; embryo broadly conic, broadly cylindric, or elongate; endosperm copious.
  "Reference": "The genus *Alocasia* is vegetatively similar to *Colocasia* but may be readily differentiated by the presence of wax glands present in axils of the primary lateral veins and midrib on the abaxial surface of the leaf and by the mature fruit that are orange or red, odorless, and contain a few large seeds, this in marked contrast to *Colocasia* in which the fruits are inconspicuously colored, smelly, and contain many tiny seeds in slimy mucilage. In addition, the placentation is basal in *Alocasia* and parietal in *Colocasia*.The genus *Alocasia* is vegetatively similar to *Colocasia* but may be readily differentiated by the presence of wax glands present in axils of the primary lateral veins and midrib on the abaxial surface of the leaf and by the mature fruit that are orange or red, odorless, and contain a few large seeds, this in marked contrast to *Colocasia* in which the fruits are inconspicuously colored, smelly, and contain many tiny seeds in slimy mucilage.

多年生热带草本。茎粗厚，短缩，大都为地下茎，稀上升或为直立地上茎，密布叶柄痕。叶具长柄，下部多少具长鞘；叶片幼时通常盾状，成年植株的多为箭状心形，边缘全缘或浅波状，有的羽状分裂几达中肋（我国不产），后裂片卵形或三角形，常部分联合；下部I级侧脉向下弯，稀辐射状，大都与后裂片基脉成直角或锐角，稀远离而成钝角；由中肋中部伸出的I级侧脉多对，斜举，集合脉2-3，极接近叶缘，II、III级脉由I级侧脉伸出，纤细，在I级侧脉之间汇合为细集合脉。花序柄后叶抽出，常多数集成短缩的、具苞片的合轴。佛焰苞管部卵形、长圆形，席卷，宿存，果期逐渐不整齐地撕裂；檐部长圆形，通常舟状，后期后翻，从管部上缘脱落。肉穗花序短于佛焰苞，粗厚，圆柱形，直立，雌花序短，锥状圆柱形，不育雄花序（中性花序）通常明显变狭；能育雄花序圆柱形；附属器圆锥形，有不规则的槽纹。花单性，无花被。能育雄花为合生雄蕊柱，倒金字塔形，顶部截平，近六角形，有雄蕊3-8，花药线状长圆形，具药隔，紧靠，通常延长几达雄蕊基部，裂缝短，上部圆形，花粉粉末状。不育雄花为合生假雄蕊，扁平，倒金字塔形，顶部截平。雌花有心皮3-4，子房卵形或长圆形，花柱开始短，后来不明显，柱头扁头状，先端多少3-4裂；1室，但有时最上端为3-4室；胚珠少数，直生，直立、半倒生；珠柄极短，基底胎座。浆果大都红色，椭圆形，倒圆锥状椭圆形或近球形，冠以宿存柱头，1室，种子少数或单1；种子近球形，直立，有不明显的种阜，表皮薄，种皮厚，光滑，内种皮薄，光滑，珠柄短。胚乳丰富。胚在种，子顶端弯向子房室顶。

约70种。分布于热带亚洲。我国有4种，产长江以南各热带地区。

与芋属Colocasia外形很相似，所不同的是：能育雄蕊顶部截平，近六角形，有雄蕊3-8，花药线状长圆形，裂缝短；子房1室，有时上端3-4室；胚珠少数，直立，直生或半倒生，珠柄极短，基底胎座；浆果内种子少数或单1，种皮光滑无棱脊。
