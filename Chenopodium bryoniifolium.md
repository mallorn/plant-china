> The name *Chenopodium* *atripliciforme* Murr (sometimes incorrectly cited as “*atriplicifolium*”) has often been treated as a synonym of *C*. *bryoniifolium*, or misidentified as *C*. *opulifolium* Schrader ex Candolle. However, *C*. *atripliciforme* is a separate species reported from NE Afghanistan, N India, and N Pakistan. Judging from several herbarium specimens available, it probably also occurs in the mountains of SC Asia. It may also be expected to occur in W China.
