2.**Coix aquatica** Roxburgh",

> All forms of the variable, perennial, aquatic *Coix* are included here in a single species. Some forms with a supposedly non-creeping habit have been separated as *C. gigantea* Roxburgh (1832), but this name is a later homonym of *C. gigantea* Koenig (1788), a different grass now placed in *Chionachne*. It is, in any case, very uncertain whether this difference in habit, which is usually impossible to determine in herbarium specimens often lacking the basal parts, is real or simply a response to the environment.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This species covers a range of chromosome levels. A form with very narrow leaf blades is the basis of *Coix lingulata*. Similar narrow-leaved specimens have been shown to have a chromosome number of 2*n* = 10. The utricle apex is sometimes extended into a leaflike, green blade. The occurrence of this feature is sporadic, and it can vary from a minute vestige to a blade ca. 3 cm or more long, even on the same plant. The leaf blades are often spotted with tubercles, which appear to be glandular and carry a short bristle-hair. These tubercle-hairs vary from dense to very sparse. The male spikelets are tightly packed into a conelike raceme, and are on average broader with broader marginal wings than in *C. lacryma-jobi*, but there is much variation.

## Description
Perennial, aquatic. Culms creeping and rooting from nodes at base, sometimes floating, up to 30 m long, ca. 1 cm in diam., flowering stems up to 2 m tall, more than 10-noded. Leaf sheaths smooth, glabrous or upper sheaths tuberculate-hispid; leaf blades narrowly to broadly linear, up to 100 × (0.3–)1–2.5 cm, hispid with tubercle-based hairs on both surfaces or almost glabrous, midvein stout, base rounded, margins scabrous, apex slenderly acuminate; ligule ca. 1 mm, margin ciliate. Male raceme 2.5–7 cm, drooping, spikelets mostly in triads, closely imbricate; utricle ovoid, longer than broad, bony, shiny, 10–14 × 5–7 mm, white or pale brown, sometimes with a median transverse line, apex occasionally extended into a green blade. Male spikelets broadly elliptic, 8–12 mm; glumes many-veined, lower glume winged on keels, wing (0.4–)0.7–1.2(–1.5) mm wide, margin ciliolate; anthers 4–5.5 mm. Fl. and fr. Aug–Nov. 2*n* = 10, 20, 40.

> Lakes, streams, marshy borders, open water; 500–1800 m. Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan [Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Malaysia, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Vietnam].
