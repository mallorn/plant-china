14.**Cyrtomium muticum** (Christ) Ching Index Filic., Suppl. 3: 66. 1933.",

> *Cyrtomium muticum* is usually treated as a synonym of *C. macrophyllum*, but it has more pairs of pinnae per lamina and its pinnae are rounded-cuneate to cuneate at base. Interestingly, *C. muticum* has different *rbcL* and *trnL-F* sequences from the latter. However, its distribution is insufficiently known. More studies are needed.
