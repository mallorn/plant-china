## Description
Plants terrestrial, 25-150 cm. Rhizomes short, erect or rarely prostrate, apex covered by lanceolate scales. Fronds tufted; stipe stramineous, brown, or castaneous, scaly throughout; stipe scales brown or blackish brown, narrowly to ovate-lanceolate, never clathrate or iridescent (as those in *Ctenitis*). Lamina lanceolate to ovate, once pinnate with deeply lobed pinnae to amply 3-pinnate; basal pinnae oblong, lanceolate, or triangular, usually not or slightly longer than next pair, basal basiscopic lobe or pinnule mostly not enlarged; distal pinnae adnate to rachis and ± decurrent at their bases; veins free; lamina papery, adaxial surface with thick multicellular hairs; rachises and costae grooved and densely covered with ctenitoid hairs or sometimes with hair-scales (structure intermediate between hairs and scales) on adaxial surface, various scale types present or not on abaxial surface. Sori terminal or dorsal on veins, medial to submarginal, one line on either side of costules; indusia present, persistent; spores ellipsoid to spheroidal, perispore echinate or coarsely tuberculate. *x* = 41.
  "Statistics": "Sixteen species: tropical and subtropical Asia, southwest to S India and Sri Lanka, east to Japan and the Philippines, south to Malaysia and Indonesia, most diverse in the S and SE Himalaya; nine species (five endemic) in China.

1 Fronds 3-pinnate to 4-pinnatifid, with many free pinnules present; basal stipe scales broadly lanceolate or ovate-lanceolate, generally 2-5 mm wide; abaxial surface of costae with few scales except in *D. ×holttumii*; perispore coarsely tuberculate——(2)
1 Fronds 2-pinnate or rarely 3-pinnatifid, if present pinnules usually adnate to costae; scales on stipe base narrowly lanceolate, usually less than 1 mm wide; abaxial surface of costae copiously scaly; perispore sharply echinate——(4)
