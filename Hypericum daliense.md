45.**Hypericum daliense** N. Robson",

> *Hypericum daliense* resembles a large form of *H. wightianum* (to which it is clearly closely related), differing from that species inter alia in its larger flowers, larger, all sessile and mostly elliptic-oblong leaves (which are all entire, i.e., the upper ones are not basally glandular-fimbriate), and larger, cylindric-ellipsoid capsule. It provides a morphological link between *H. wightianum* and the *H. macrosepalum* form of *H. przewalskii* from N Yunnan.

## Description
Herbs, perennial, 0.15-0.4 m tall, erect from creeping and rooting base; stems single or few, unbranched (?always). Stems 4-angled when young, soon terete or faintly 2-lined, eglandular. Leaves sessile; blade elliptic-oblong to (upper) lanceolate, 2.2-4.5 × 0.7-2.1 cm, thinly papery, abaxially paler, not glaucous; laminar gland dots pale, dense, ± small; intramarginal glands black, dense; main lateral veins 4-paired (lowermost weak), tertiary reticulation rather dense; base rounded-amplexicaul, margin entire, apex rounded. Inflorescence 5-14-flowered, from 1 or 2 nodes, nearly flat-topped, congested; bracts and bracteoles lanceolate to narrowly elliptic, with margin and auricles reddish- to black-glandular-ciliate or rarely subentire with a few intramarginal black glands. Flowers 1-1.5 cm in diam., stellate; buds ellipsoid. Sepals free or nearly so, erect, subequal or equal, lanceolate to narrowly oblong-elliptic, 4.5-6.5 × 1-1.5 mm, glandular-ciliate; laminar glands all pale lines or usually distal part(s) black, streaks or dots; marginal glands reddish or black; apex acute; veins 5, outer pair branched. Petals bright yellow, oblong-oblanceolate, 6-8 × 2.5-3.5 mm; laminar glands absent; marginal glands black, few, subapical, sessile; margin entire. Stamens 25-35, apparently 3-fascicled, longest 5-6 mm, 0.75-0.8 × as long as petals. Ovary ellipsoid; styles 3, 2-2.5 mm, ca. as long as ovary or slightly longer, divaricate. Capsule cylindric-ellipsoid, ca. 7 × 4.5 mm, slightly exceeding sepals. Seeds not seen. Fl. Jul-Aug, fr. ?
