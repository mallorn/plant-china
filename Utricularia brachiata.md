Perennials, lithophytic. Tuber 1, at peduncle base, globose to ellipsoid, 1-2 mm. Rhizoids and stolons capillary, simple. Traps on rhizoids and stolons, stalked, ovoid, ca. 1 mm, mouth lateral; appendage 1, dorsal, transversely elliptic to flabellate, fringed with multicellular stipitate glands. Leaves few, from tuber, glabrous; leaf blade reniform, 1-3 cm × 2.5-6 mm, membranous, veins dichotomously branched, base cordate and attenuate onto long petiole, margin entire, apex rounded to emarginate. Inflorescences erect, 3-8 cm, 1- or 2-flowered, glabrous; peduncle terete, 0.2-0.4 mm thick; scales absent; bracts basisolute, oblong, ca. 1.5 mm, base truncate to emarginate, margin erosely denticulate, apex rounded. Pedicel spreading, 2-8 mm, filiform, dorsiventrally compressed; bracteoles basisolute, similar to bracts. Calyx lobes 3-4 mm, glabrous; lower lobe oblong, much smaller than upper lobe, apex emarginate; upper lobe orbicular, apex emarginate. Corolla white, with a yellow spot at base of lower lip and violet streaks on upper lip; lower lip suborbicular, distinctly 5-lobed; spur narrowly cylindric, 2 or more × as long as upper calyx lobe, apex obtuse; palate with a slightly raised rim, fringed with moniliform hairs; upper lip much shorter than upper calyx lobe, apex 2-lobed. Filaments ca. 0.5 mm, curved; anther thecae ± distinct. Ovary globose; style very short; stigma lower lip circular, upper lip obsolete. Capsule globose with a ventral keel, ca. 2.5 mm, dehiscing by a longitudinal ventral slit. Seeds ovoid, ca. 0.5 mm, with a tuft of hairs of variable length at each end usually ± as long as body of seed and a few shorter hairs on distal surface. Fl. Jul-Sep, fr. Aug-Oct.
