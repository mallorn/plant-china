29.**Elaeocarpus lanceifolius** Roxburgh",

> One of us (Chamlong Phengklai) believes that *Elaeocarpus lacunosus* is synonymous with this species. However, the other of us (Tang Ya) differentiates these on account of *E. lacunosus* having puberulent branchlets and cuneate or obtuse leaf bases and *E. lanceifolius* having glabrous branchlets and cuneate, ± decurrent leaf bases.
