## Description
Fronds obovate to elliptic, 1.5-8 mm, 1.5-3 × as long as wide, flat or gibbous, usually with papillae on upper surface along midvein. Roots (1 or)2-7(-12), all perforating scale, 0.5-7 cm. Turions not seen. Ovary with 1 or 2 ovules. Fruit laterally winged toward apex. Seed with 10-15 distinct ribs. Fl. (rare) Jun-Sep. 2*n* = 40*, 46, 50.
  "Reference": "*Spirodela sichuanensis* was thought to be distinct from *Landoltia punctata* (as *S. punctata*) by its utricular scale surrounding the flower having two lateral slits instead of one as in *L. punctata*. However, two slits can be occasionally observed from various geographical races of *L. punctata*. Due to the rarity of flowering, the frequency of this character is hard to estimate. In general, all the vegetative characters of *S. sichuanensis* are included in the range of morphological variation of *L. punctata*.*Spirodela sichuanensis* was thought to be distinct from *Landoltia punctata* (as *S. punctata*) by its utricular scale surrounding the flower having two lateral slits instead of one as in *L. punctata*.
