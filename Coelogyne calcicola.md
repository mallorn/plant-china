13.**Coelogyne calcicola** Kerr J. Siam Soc., Nat. Hist. Suppl. 9: 233. 1933.

## Description
Pseudobulbs 3-4 cm apart on a stout, creeping, sheathed rhizome, ovoid, 5-10 cm, angled, with 2 leaves, enclosed with persistent bracts at base. Leaf blade oblong-lanceolate or oblong-obovate, 13-20 × 4-5.5 cm, abaxially minutely verrucose, many veined, prominent abaxially, somewhat acute; petiole 3.8-6 cm, narrow. Inflorescence hysteranthous, erect, rigid; peduncle bare, 7-15 cm, with 6 or 7 densely imbricate, convolute, sheathing sterile bracts at interface between peduncle and rachis; rachis 5-7 cm; flowers up to 6, opening simultaneously. Flowers spreading, sepals and petals creamy white. Dorsal sepal oblong-lanceolate, ca. 28 × 14 mm, 7-9-veined, somewhat acute; lateral sepals oblong-lanceolate, ca. 27 × 9 mm, 7-9-veined, somewhat acute. Petals linear, ca. 26 × 3.5 mm, 3-veined, obtuse; lip ca. 27 × 25 mm, 3-lobed; lateral lobes small compared with remainder of lip, rounded, front margin fimbriate; mid-lobe quadrangular, ca. 13 × 14 mm, margin long fimbriate except around tip; callus with 2 lamellae extending from base of lip and reaching middle of mid-lobe, fimbriate, toward tip keels broadening into a warty protrusion. Column slightly arched, ca. 17 mm, hood winged. Fl. Apr-May.

  "Reference": "This plant was first reported from Yunnan by Seidenfaden (Dansk Bot. Ark. 29(4): 71. 1975), based on *Forrest 18715* (K). It is similar to *Coelogyne sanderae* in having a fimbriate-margined lip and three fimbriate-hairy lamellae. But in the specimen collected from Yunnan, the central lamella is very short (3-4 mm), and the lateral two lamellae are almost not fimbriate when extending to mid-lobe.This plant was first reported from Yunnan by Seidenfaden (Dansk Bot.

**19. 滇西贝母兰（兰花——中国兰科植物集锦）**

Coelogyne calcicola Kerr in J. Siam Soc. Nat. Hist. Suppl. 9: 233. fig. 3. 1933; Seidenf. in Dansk Bot. Ark. 29 (4): 71. fig. 29. 1975, et in Opera Bot. 114: 117. 1992; Averyanov, Iden. Guide Vietnam. Orch. 134. 1994.

此种植物系G. Seidenfaden（1975）首次报告产于我国云南。它与撕裂贝母兰Coelogyne sanderae Kraezl.十分接近，唇瓣中裂片与侧裂片边缘有流苏，褶片亦分裂成流苏状毛，区别点在于本种流苏状褶片仅2条，且延伸至中裂片时变为不裂或仅顶端稍分裂，而决非流苏状，中央1条褶片长仅3-4毫米，位于唇盘基部。《兰花-中国兰科植物集锦》(1993)中有一幅本种照片，系拍摄于云南盈江树上，海拔900米，但未采到标本。据照片看很可能是本种。唐进、汪发缵在手稿中曾将此种归并入撕裂贝母兰C. sanderae，也未必是没有根据的。此两种间的界限是否稳定，有否交叉，尚需进一步的研究。

产云南西南部（盈江、镇康）。生于树上，海拔900-1450米。老挝、越南也有分布。模式标本采自老挝。
