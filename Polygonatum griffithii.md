24.**Polygonatum griffithii** Baker",

> One of us (Tamura) has not seen specimens of this species which, according to Chen (Fl. Xizang. 5: 572. 1987), is related to &lt;I&gt; P. cathcartii&lt;/I&gt;. The chromosome number 2&lt;I&gt; n&lt;/I&gt; = 36 was reported for &lt;I&gt; P. griffithii&lt;/I&gt; from SE Xizang (Mêdog Xian) by Gu and Sun (Acta Bot. Yunnan. 20: 207--210. 1998), but judging from the photograph of the chromosomes in the paper, the karyotype corresponds well with that of &lt;I&gt; Maianthemum&lt;/I&gt;.

Peduncle and pedicels 1.2--2 cm. Flowers paired. Perianth tube white, constricted above ovary; lobes green, deltoid, very short. Stamens inserted at mouth of perianth tube; filaments very short, naked; anthers small. Style filiform, 2--3 × as long as the ovary. 2&lt;I&gt; n&lt;/I&gt; = ?36*.

> About 1700 m. Xizang [Nepal].
