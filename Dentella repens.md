Leaves subsessile to shortly petiolate; petiole to 1[-4] mm; blade drying stiffly papery, oblong-lanceolate, oblanceolate, or spatulate, 4-7[-10] × 1-2[-4] mm, glabrous or sparsely hirtellous at least along margins and principal veins, base cuneate to acute, margins flat, apex obtuse to acute; secondary veins not visible; stipules triangular, ca. 1 mm, entire to erose. Flowers solitary at forks of branchlets or rarely along stems, subsessile or with pedicel to 1[-2] mm.

Nansha Islands, 200-201. 1996): *Dentella repens* var. *repens*, with flowers ca. 3 mm, and *D. repens* var. *grandis*, with flowers 6-8 mm; their description of the second variety corresponds to the larger flower measurements given in Fl. Taiwan. These varieties were subsequently synonymized by H. S. Lo (in FRPS 71(1): 21. 1999) and are provisionally synonymized here.The Fl.
