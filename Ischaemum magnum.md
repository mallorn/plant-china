Racemes terminal, paired, appressed back to back, 6–12 cm; rachis internodes columnar, slightly expanded upward, triquetrous, ciliate along outer angle, sometimes only at base, inner angles glabrous. Sessile spikelet oblong-lanceolate, 6.5–8 × 1.7–2 mm; lower glume 2-keeled throughout, leathery except near apex, usually with 2–4 marginal tubercles in lower half, sometimes almost smoooth, or tubercles transversely connected into coarse shallow ridges, herbaceous above with anastomosing green veins, keels narrowly winged; upper lemma entire, awnless or mucronate, or 2-lobed and awned; awn up to 1 cm, weakly geniculate. Pedicelled spikelet dorsally compressed, equaling or slightly longer than sessile, strongly asymmetrical, winged on one keel only, wing 0.3–1.5 mm wide, awnless; pedicel very short, stout.
