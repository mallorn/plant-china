37.**Wikstroemia subcyclolepidota** L. P. Liu & Y. S. Lian",

> *Wikstroemia subcyclolepidota* is known to us only from the protologue. The almost amplexicaul disk scale and relatively slender, thyrselike inflorescence seem extremely distinctive, and Halda’s inclusion of this species within *W. pampaninii* is therefore not accepted.
