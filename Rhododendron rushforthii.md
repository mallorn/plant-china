178.**Rhododendron rushforthii** Argent & D. F. Chamberlain",

> This species is closely allied to *Rhododendron datiandingense*, and may be conspecific, although the flowers are significantly larger. The glaucous leaves are a significant feature of *R*. *rushforthii*. It was originally described from Lao Cai Province, N Vietnam, close to the border with S Yunnan at Pingbian. It is known from cultivated material said to have come from S China.
