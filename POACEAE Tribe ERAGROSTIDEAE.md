22.**POACEAE Tribe ERAGROSTIDEAE**",

> This tribe is characterized by unspecialized spikelets usually with several florets, 3-veined lemmas, and a rather cartilaginous texture, and also by a ciliate ligule, although there are exceptions to all these characters. This contrasts with the 5-veined lemmas and membranous ligule of most *Poeae*, which are often superficially similar, especially when the inflorescence is a panicle. Anatomically the two tribes are quite different.

## Description
Annual or perennial. Leaf blades linear to filiform; ligule a line of hairs, infrequently membranous. Inflorescence a panicle or composed of tough unilateral racemes of biseriate spikelets (bottlebrush in *Harpachne*); racemes digitate or scattered along an axis or rarely single, persistent or deciduous. Spikelets usually laterally compressed, with one floret or more usually several to many, the uppermost ± reduced, disarticulating below each floret or sometimes by other abscission modes; glumes mostly persistent, usually 1-veined, membranous and shorter than lowest lemma, rarely longer; floret callus sometimes bearded; lemmas membranous to leathery, 1–3-veined (7–11 in *Aeluropus*), glabrous or hairy, apex entire or 2–3-toothed occasionally with small subsidiary lobes between teeth, mucronate or awned from apex or sinus; palea keels sometimes winged. Stamens 1–3. Fruit sometimes with free pericarp. Leaf anatomy: Kranz PS type; microhairs usually short and stout. *x* = 10, less often 9, 12.
  "Statistics": "About 80 genera and 1000 species; tropics and subtropics; 17 genera and 92 species (30 endemic, three introduced) in China.
