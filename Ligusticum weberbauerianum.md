17.**Ligusticum weberbauerianum** Fedde ex H. Wolff

> Recent research has suggested that this poorly known species and *Ligusticum* *pilgerianum* H. Wolff (Repert. Spec. Nov Regni Veg. 27: 307. 1930, not Fedde ex H. Wolff, loc. cit. 322. 1930) are conspecific with *Notopterygium* *incisum*. Certainly the petal shape is unusual in *Ligusticum*, but further work is needed to confirm these findings; if upheld the name *N*. *weberbaurianum* should be applied to the taxon. *Ligusticum* *pilgerianum* H. Wolff was described from Sichuan, and is allied to *L*. *acuminatum* according to the original description, but we have not seen the type (*H*. *Smith* *3544*).
