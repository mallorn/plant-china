3.**Phacelurus trichophyllus** S. L. Zhong",

> This grass occurs at generally higher altitudes than *Phacelurus latifolius*. The pedicelled spikelet varies from well developed to much reduced, even in adjacent spikelet pairs on the same raceme.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two specimens with solitary racemes have been described as new species in *Rhytachne*. That genus is not known in Asia and can usually be distinguished from *Phacelurus* by a much more delicate habit, cylindrical racemes, and a frequently foliaceous pedicel. The occasional occurrence of spikelet triads in this species is reminiscent of *Mnesithea*. However, it is excluded from that genus by its well-developed male lower floret, and also from *Rottboellia* by its free pedicel.

## Description
Perennial, shortly rhizomatous. Culms erect, 1–2 m tall, 3–4 mm in diam., many-noded, branching in upper part. Leaf sheaths hispid with short, tubercle-based hairs or glabrous, usually longer than internodes; leaf blades lanceolate, papery, 10–20 × 1–2.5 cm, sparsely hispid with short, scattered, tubercle-based hairs, base rounded, margins serrulate, apex acuminate; ligule 0.5–1 mm. Inflorescence of 1–6 subdigitate racemes. Racemes up to 15 cm or more, stiffly suberect, spikelets normally paired, occasionally triads of 2 sessile and 1 pedicelled present; rachis internodes columnar, laterally sharply keeled, back rounded or obtusely keeled, lowest internode elongate, much exceeding sessile spikelet, successive internodes shorter. Sessile spikelet 6–7 mm; callus shortly pilose; lower glume lanceolate to ovate, leathery, back flat or slightly convex, obscurely ribbed, margins incurved, ciliolate, keeled and scabrid below apex; upper glume scabrid on keel toward apex; lower floret staminate, palea present; upper lemma and palea subequal, 2 styles arising separately from ovary apex, not elongate. Pedicelled spikelet variable, resembling sessile spikelet but slightly smaller or much reduced; pedicel stoutly oblong, straight. Fl. and fr. Aug–Oct.
