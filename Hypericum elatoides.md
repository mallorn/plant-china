7.**Hypericum elatoides** R. Keller",

> *Hypericum elatoides* is most closely related to *H. monogynum*, in particular to an ovate- to oblong-leaved form from Jiangsu belonging to form (iii). It is rather similar to *H. prattii* (from Sichuan), but differs from it by the apically obtuse to rounded (not acute to apiculate), rela tively narrower leaves and the small, triangular-ovate, often minutely reddish-glandular-ciliate sepals. In *H. prattii* , the sepals are large and ovate-lanceolate to elliptic with an entire margin.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tardily deciduous petals and stamens, suffruticose habit, and sometimes gland-margined sepals make this species anomalous in *Hypericum* sect. *Ascyreia* , but it is better placed there than in a separate section. With these characters, in fact, it forms a link between *H.* sect. *Ascyreia* and the Caucasian *H.* sect. *Bupleuroides* Stefanoff.

## Description
Suffrutex, 35-82 cm tall; stems solitary or few, usually slender, erect from ascending or creeping, branching and rooting base, unbranched below inflorescence. Stems shallowly 4-lined below nodes, sometimes 2-lined below or becoming nearly terete; internodes (3-)4.5-10.5 cm, shorter than leaves. Leaves sessile or with petiole to 1.5 mm; blade oblong or oblong-triangular to broadly ovate, 4.4-11 × 1.8-5 cm, thinly papery, abaxially rather paler, not glaucous; laminar glands, very small, streaks to dots; abaxial glands absent; main lateral veins 4- or 5-paired, main midvein branches nearly equally strong, tertiary reticulation dense and abaxially prominent; base cordate-amplexicaul to truncate, apex obtuse to short apiculate or rounded. Inflorescence (1-)5-13-flowered, from 1 or 2 nodes, rarely with flowering branches from one node below, the whole lax, flat-topped; bracts and bracteoles linear-lanceolate to linear-elliptic, persistent. Pedicels (0.3-)1-5 cm. Flowers 4-8 cm in diam., stellate, with petals becoming reflexed, tardily deciduous; buds narrowly ovoid, apex ± acute. Sepals free or to 1/4 united, erect to suberect, ovate to triangular-ovate, equal, 3-5(-7) × 1.5-3(-5) mm, laminar glands lines with the outer interrupted, marginal glands reddish or absent, margin entire or occasionally minutely irregularly reddish glandular-ciliate, apex obtuse to acute. Petals bright yellow, 2.5-4 cm × 7-10(-15) mm, 6-8 × as long as sepals, oblanceolate; margin entire, eglandular; apiculus absent. Stamen fascicles each with 45-60 stamens, longest 1.5-2.5 cm, 0.5-0.65(-0.8) × as long as petals. Ovary ± broadly ovoid, 4-6(-7) × 3.5-4.5 mm; styles 1.3-1.9 cm, 2.3-4.5 × as long as ovary, united nearly to apices then outcurved. Capsule broadly to narrowly ovoid or ovoid-conic, 0.9-1.6 cm × 6-11 mm. Seeds dark reddish brown, 1.1-1.5 mm, very shallowly carinate; testa densely reticulate. Fl. May-Jul, fr. Jul-Aug.

上述两种，根据N. Robson的意见（私人通信）应放入黄海棠组Sect. Roscyna(Spach)R.Keller中，它们两者位于大叶金丝桃H. prattii Hemsl. 和突脉金丝桃H.przewa lskii Maxim。之间，但我们未见标本，暂志于此。
