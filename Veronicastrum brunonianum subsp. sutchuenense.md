1b.**Veronicastrum brunonianum subsp. sutchuenense** (Franchet) D. Y. Hong",

> The type locality of &lt;I&gt;Calorhabdos sutchuenensis&lt;/I&gt; is Chengkou, E Sichuan, from where the specimens examined seem to be rather different from typical &lt;I&gt;Veronicastrum brunonianum&lt;/I&gt; in having stems winged and filaments glabrous. However, the examination of two specimens from the Shennongjia Mountains of W Hubei showed that one had winged stems and hairy filaments, while the other had wingless stems and glabrous filaments.

## Description
