黄花老鹳草
47.**Geranium suzukii** Masamune

> According to some authors, this species is related to *Geranium nepalense* and *G. sibiricum*, from which it differs by the leaf and petal characters mentioned in the key. *Geranium suzukii* is a trailing herb, constantly rooting at the nodes. It usually has glandular trichomes restricted to the sepals and sometimes to the fruit. The petals are white or pale pink, not yellow as some authors have mentioned. This was stated in the protologue and has been observed in cultivated specimens.
