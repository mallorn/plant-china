12.**Fabaceae Tribe GENISTEAE** GENISTEAE",

## Description
This tribe comprises 25 genera and 550-570 species, mainly distributed in Africa and Europe, but with most species of *Lupinus* in North and South America. The 13 Chinese species (in seven genera) are all introduced and cultivated, and the present authors are not aware of any among them having become naturalized. Therefore, full treatments are not provided here; instead there follow a synopsis and key to the genera and species.*Cytisus* Desfontaines (&amp;#37329;&amp;#38592;&amp;#20799;&amp;#23646; jin que er shu). One species is widely cultivated: *C. scoparius* (Linnaeus) Link (Enum. Hort. Berol. Alt. 2: 241. 1822; *Spartium scoparium* Linnaeus, Sp. Pl. 2: 709. 1753), native to the N Atlantic islands and Europe.*Lembotropis* Grisebach (&amp;#21464;&amp;#40657;&amp;#37329;&amp;#38592;&amp;#20799;&amp;#23646; bian hei jin que er shu). One species is widely cultivated: *L. nigricans* (Linnaeus) Grisebach (Spic. Fl. Rumel. 1: 10. 1843; *Cytisus nigricans* Linnaeus, Sp. Pl. 2: 739. 1753), native to C and SE Europe.
  "Statistics": "*Genista* Linnaeus (&amp;#26579;&amp;#26009;&amp;#26408;&amp;#23646; ran liao mu shu). One species is widely cultivated: *G. tinctoria* Linnaeus (Sp. Pl. 2: 710. 1753; *G. sibirica* Linnaeus), native from W Europe to Kazakhstan and W Siberia, approaching the N borders of China. It might be expected to occur as a native species in N parts of Xinjiang, Nei Mongol, or Heilongjiang.
