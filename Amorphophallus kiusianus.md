Inflorescence solitary, long pedunculate; peduncle colored as petiole, 40-100 cm (in fruit to ca. 120 cm), 1.5-4 cm in diam. Spathe outside dark greenish, greenish pinkish, or glossy dark purplish brown, with small, whitish spots, margin with a narrow, reddish violet line, inside pale pinkish with a purplish base, purplish and greenish, or entirely dark brown, with or without a greenish margin, latter sometimes flushed pinkish, sometimes only medially pale green, otherwise with rounded, whitish spots, base outside dark green or dark greenish brown, with small, rounded whitish spots and blackish green veins, triangular, base rounded, 9-25 × 4-13 cm, shallowly or clearly constricted between base and limb; limb at first oblique, then reflexing and bending downward, margin reflexed or undulate; base within dark purple and with numerous ± distant, conic warts, occasionally with small, whitish spots.

Amorphophallus sinensis Belval in Bull. Soc. Bot. France 80: 98. 1933.

块茎扁球形，直径3-20厘米。鳞叶2，卵形，披针状卵形，有青紫色、淡红色斑块。叶柄长可达1.5米，光滑，绿色，具白色斑块；叶片3裂，第一次裂片二歧分叉，最后羽状深裂，小裂片卵状长圆形，渐尖，长6-10厘米，宽3-3.5厘米。花序柄长25-45厘米，光滑，绿色，具白色斑块。佛焰苞长15-20厘米，管部席卷，外面绿色，具白色斑块，内面暗青紫色，基部有疣皱，长6-8厘米，粗1-2厘米，檐部展开为斜漏斗状，边缘波状，膜质，长渐尖，直立，后外仰，外面淡绿色，内面淡红色，边缘带杂色，二面均有白色圆形斑块，长12-15厘米，人为展平宽9-10厘米。肉穗花序长10-22厘米，雌花序长2-3厘米，粗1-1.2厘米；雄花序长3-4厘米，粗0.7-1.2厘米；附属器长圆锥状，长7-14厘米，粗0.8-1.8厘米，常为花序长的2倍，深青紫色，散生长约10毫米的紫色硬毛。雄蕊3-4，药隔外凸。子房球形，花柱不存在，柱头不明显地浅裂，2室。浆果红色，变蓝色。花期5月。 本种常被认作磨芋A. rivieri Durieu，但附属器有毛；佛焰苞檐部外面苍绿色，内面淡红色，二面有白色的圆形斑块；子房无花柱，附属器有毛，均较易于识别。

我国特有，产江苏、浙江、福建大部分地区，海拔800米以下，常见于林下、灌丛中，或种植于房前屋后。模式标本采自上海。

块茎供药用，外敷蛇虫咬伤、无名肿毒、流火、颈淋巴结核、癌肿、红斑性狼疮。也可加工为磨芋豆腐作蔬食。
