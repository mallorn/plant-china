> *Cheiropleuria integrifolia* is distinct from *C. bicuspis* by the normal condition of entire fronds, with fewer (3 or 4) main veins, and the narrower divergent angle in the lobed lamina. In China, lobed and unlobed individuals often occur in the same population and even on the same rhizome. Further studies on Chinese populations are needed.

## Description
Rhizome creeping, short, densely covered with hairs; hairs soft, pale brown, to 5 mm or more, multicellular. Stipes approximate, glabrous except near base; stipes of sterile fronds 15-25 cm, of fertile fronds 15-25 cm or longer. Sterile lamina ovate, entire, rarely shallowly forked distally, base rounded, apex acute or lobed, sinus angles 30°-40°; main veins 3 or 4 at base of lamina, veinlets anastomosing, areoles with branching included veinlets. Fertile lamina simple, elliptic, 5-10 × 1-1.5 cm, papery, abaxial surface wholly covered with sporangia in acrostichoid condition except on main veins and narrow strip at margins. Paraphyses abundant, club-shaped.

> Terrestrial in forests; 500-800 m. Guangdong, Guangxi, Taiwan [S Japan].
