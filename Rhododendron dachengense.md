> The original author placed this species in *Rhododendron* subsect. *Taliensia* but suggested that its affinities were with *R*. *haematodes* in *R*. subsect. *Neriiflora*. From the original description and accompanying plate, *R*. *dachengense* appears allied to, and is possibly conspecific with, *R*. *roxieoides*.
