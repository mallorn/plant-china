> *Pteris caiyangheensis* is similar to *P. aspericaulis* var. *aspericaulis* but differs in having lamina ovate-triangular, 2-pinnatipartite, 3-forked; stipe 2 × as long as lamina; and indusia flavescent. It is treated as a synonym of *P. aspericaulis* var. *tricolor* by Zhang Xianchun in the Catalogue of Life, China (http://data.sp2000.cn/2010_cnnode_e/show_ species_details.php?name_code=90ed8812-a375-40c9-9b84-c224c315 ed89; accessed 9 Jan 2012).
