## Description
Leaves with transverse septate nodes between veins. Involucral bracts leafy, sheathed, rarely shortly sheathed or not sheathed. Spikes 3-8; male spikes 1-4, rarely up to 7, borne at top of culm; remaining spikes female, single in an involucral bract axil, cylindric, densely many flowered, pedunculate. Female glumes lanceolate, narrowly ovate, or oblong-ovate, usually 3-veined, apex acuminate, mucronate or aristate. Utricles obliquely patent, ovate or oblong-ovate, slightly inflated or inflated trigonous, laxly or densely pubescent or hispidulous, rarely glabrous, distinctly several veined, apex gradually narrowed to a medium-sized beak, orifice rather long 2-toothed. Nutlets rather loosely or tightly enveloped in utricle, apex slightly long mucronate; style base not thickened; stigmas 3 (*Carex humida* with stigmas 2).
