## Description
Plants perennial, mostly terrestrial, rarely epiphytic, usually small and fleshy, lacking sclerenchyma. Roots lacking root hairs, unbranched or with a few narrow lateral branches [rarely dichotomously branched], fibrous or fleshy, sometimes producing vegetative buds. Rhizome mostly erect, less often horizontal, rarely branched, eustelic, glabrous or hairy. Fronds 1 to few per plant, monomorphic, vernation nodding (not circinate), erect or folded, stipe base dilated, clasping, forming open or fused sheath surrounding successive leaf buds; buds glabrous or with long, uniseriate hairs; common stipe usually dividing into sterile, laminate, photosynthetic portion (trophophore) and fertile, spore-bearing portion (sporophore); sterile lamina ternately or pinnately compound to simple, rarely absent, glabrous or with scattered, long, uniseriate hairs, especially on stipe and rachis; veins anastomosing or free, pinnate, or palmate. Sporophores 1 per frond [rarely more], spikelike or pinnately branched; sporangia exposed or embedded, sometimes clustered on very short lateral branches, wall 2 cells thick, annulus absent; spores many (&gt; 1000) per sporangium, globose-tetrahedral, trilete, thick-walled, surface rugate, tuberculate, baculate (with projecting rods usually higher than wide), sometimes joined in delicate network, mostly with ± warty surface. Gametophytes subterranean, usually fleshy, mycorrhizal, non-photosynthetic, orbicular or linear. *x* = 30, (44), 45, (46), 94.

**一、瓶尔小草科——Ophioglossaceae**

陆生植物，少为附生，植物一般为小形，直立或少为悬垂。根状茎短而直立，有肉质粗根，叶有营养叶与孢子叶之分，出自总柄，营养叶单一，全缘，1-2片，少有更多的，披针形或卵形，叶脉网状，中脉不明显；孢子叶有柄，自总柄或营养叶的基部生出；孢子囊形大，无柄，下陷，沿囊托两侧排列，形成狭穗状，横裂。孢子四面形。

有四属，分布于全世界。我国有下面两属。
