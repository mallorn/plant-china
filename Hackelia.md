假鹤虱属
29.**Hackelia** Opiz ex Berchtold

> About 45 species: mainly in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, and Central and South America; three species in China.&#x0D;\n&lt;p&gt;&#x0D;\nLian &amp; Wang (Acta Phytotax. Sin. 18: 514-520. 1980; Fl. Reipubl. Popularis Sin. 64(2): 116-151. 1989) argued that the differences between &lt;I&gt;Eritrichium&lt;/I&gt; and &lt;I&gt;Hackelia&lt;/I&gt; are insufficient to keep\nthem as separate genera. However, the gynobase in &lt;I&gt;Eritrichium&lt;/I&gt; is cushion-shaped, to 1 mm high, while in &lt;I&gt;Hackelia&lt;/I&gt; it is distinctly conical and 2-3 mm high. It is likely that other species\nfrom China listed under &lt;I&gt;Eritrichium&lt;/I&gt; will need to be transferred to &lt;I&gt;Hackelia&lt;/I&gt; in the future.
