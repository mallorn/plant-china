13.**Phlegmariurus mingcheensis** Ching Acta Bot. Yunnan. 4: 125. Ma. 1982.",

> In 1982, Ching twice described the same lycophyte species under the names *Lycopodium mingcheense* (Fl. Fujian. 1: 619. Apr 1982; the original “*minchegense*“ spelling being a correctable error) and *Phlegmariurus mingcheensis*. *Phlegmariurus mingcheensis* cannot be taken as a combination based on *L. mingcheense* because in the original publication a different holotype was indicated and the name *L. mingcheense* was not mentioned. The correct names for this species in *Huperzia*, *Lycopodium*, and *Phlegmariurus* are *Huperzia mingcheensis* (Ching) Holub (basionym: *Phlegmariurus mingcheensis*), *Lycopodium mingcheense* Ching, and *Phlegmariurus mingcheensis* Ching, respectively. The lectotypification of the name *Lycopodium mingcheense* using *P. S. Chiu 2069* (PE) by Xiang et al. (Taxon 52: 857-858. 2003) was redundant since this specimen was clearly indicated as the holotype in Ching’s original publication. The replacement name *Phlegmariurus mingjoui* (X. C. Zhang, Higher Pl. China 2: 20. 2008) is an illegitimate superfluous name (see Li Bing Zhang, Taxon 61: 665-666. 2012).This species is similar to *Phlegmariurus petiolatus*, but its leaves are lanceolate (not elliptic-lanceolate) and sessile.
