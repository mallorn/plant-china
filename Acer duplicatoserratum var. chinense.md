> The taxonomic status of *Acer ceriferum* and *A. duplicatoserratum* is subject to debate. The only difference between *A. duplicatoserratum* var. *duplicatoserratum*, from Taiwan, and *A. duplicatoserratum* var. *chinense*, from mainland China, is the degree of pubescence. On the other hand, only one collection of *A. ceriferum*, a type from W Hubei, which is very pubescent along the veins and petioles including the twigs, was available for study prior to the current work. Collections of *A. duplicatoserratum* var. *chinense* from locations near Hubei and many collections, including *A. linganense*, from E China cannot be easily identified. One of us (Chang) considers that *A. duplicatoserratum* var. *duplicatoserratum* should be placed in the synonymy of *A. ceriferum*, although geographic separation of these two taxa is evident. Moreover, mainland Chinese individuals of *A. duplicatoserratum* var. *chinense* resemble *A. linganense*, which should therefore be made synonymous. In summary, *A. ceriferum*, which is a pubescent taxon, is distributed in Hubei and Taiwan; and a glabrescent taxon, for which a new combination would be required (*\"A. ceriferum* var. *chinense\"*), is distributed in E China.
