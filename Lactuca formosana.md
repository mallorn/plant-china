## Description
Herbs 0.5-1.5 m tall, annual or ?perennial. Roots ramose. Stem solitary, erect, loosely branched apically, ± hirsute, glabrescent. Lower and middle stem leaves with narrow petiole-like amplexicaul basal portion to 5 cm or with conspicuously expanded and semiamplexicaul base; leaf blade elliptic, lanceolate, or oblanceolate, 8-18 × 4-8 cm, hirsute, main rib echinulate, undivided and with coarsely dentate margin or pinnatifid with 2-5 pairs of elliptic to broadly falcate lateral lobes, faintly to strongly dentate on margin, and a lanceolate or triangular terminal lobe. Upper stem leaves similar to middle stem leaves, margin mostly ± entire. Synflorescence loosely corymbose, with ca. 10 to many capitula. Capitula with usually 25-30 florets. Involucre cylindric, 1-1.1 cm at anthesis, to 1.8 × 0.8 cm in fruit. Phyllaries acute to acuminate at apex; outer phyllaries broadly obovate to lanceolate, longest ca. 8 × 1-2 mm; inner phyllaries 8. Florets yellow. Achene 4.5-6.5 mm; body reddish brown, dark brown, or blackish brown, ellipsoid, compressed, broadly winged, 2-2.3 mm wide, with 1 prominent rib on either side, apically contracted into a usually pale to greenish filiform 2-3.5 mm beak. Pappus 7-8 mm, caducous. Fl. and fr. Apr-Nov. 2*n* = 18*.
  "Reference": "*Lactuca formosana* is similar to *L. raddeana*, *L. triangulata*, and *L. indica*, and the leaf shape of *L. formosana* in mainland China shows some variation. Instead of the typically lyrate-pinnatifid leaves with irregularly incised to dentate margin, plants sometimes have narrow, weakly pinnatifid leaves more similar to those of *L. indica*. However, usually both species can be distinguished by the shape of the synflorescence (corymbiform in *L. formosana*, paniculiform to racemiform-paniculiform in *L. indica*) and the indumentum of stem and leaves (hirsute and with echinulate main rib in *L. formosana*, glabrous in *L. indica*). Conspicuous, occasionally occurring plants with all or most leaves undivided, as are sometimes the upper stem leaves in usually pinnately lobed plants, have been treated as a separate species, *Lactuca sonchus* or *Pterocypsela sonchus*, respectively (e.g., FRPS 80(1): 231. 1997), but are here considered as a mere form of *L. formosana*, easily recognizable by the distinctive long beak of this species.*Lactuca formosana* is similar to *L. raddeana*, *L. triangulata*, and *L. indica*, and the leaf shape of *L. formosana* in mainland China shows some variation.
