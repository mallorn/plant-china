楚雄金丝桃",
9.**Hypericum fosteri** N. Robson",

> *Hypericum fosteri* is related to the widespread *H. hookerianum* and the N Thailand endemic *H. siamense* N. Robson. It differs from the former in the oblong to oblanceolate-spatulate, spreading-outcurved sepals, which are not ribbed, and in the elongate (not ovoid) capsule.
