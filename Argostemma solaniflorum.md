  "Reference": "This species appears to vary widely in size of the plants, leaf size, and pubescence; it has sometimes been characterized (e.g., FRPS 71(1): 180-182. 1999) based only on larger plants, as described in the protologue. The two synonymous names listed here were not included in FRPS but were cited in Fl.
