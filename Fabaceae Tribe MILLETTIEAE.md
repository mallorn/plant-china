17.**Fabaceae Tribe MILLETTIEAE** MILLETTIEAE",

> About 45 genera and 900-920 species: widespread in tropical and subtropical regions of the world, poorly represented in Australia, *Callerya* extending into temperate parts of China, and *Wisteria* extending into temperate parts of E Asia and North America; 13 genera and 84 species (35 en-demic, five introduced) in China.

## Description
Trees, lianas, or shrubs. Stipules often caducous. Leaves pulvinate, usually imparipinnate; leaflets (1-)5-15(to over 40), usually opposite, rarely alternate; stipels present or absent. Inflorescences various, but not in elongated racemes. Flowers often in fascicles and these arranged in pseudoracemes or pseudopanicles, sometimes on leafless branches or on main trunk. Bracteoles usually present. Calyx various, truncate or with 4 or 5 short lobes. Corolla papilionaceous; standard with or without basal calluses; wings free or ± adherent to keel. Stamens 10, monadelphous or diadelphous; vexillary filament free or connate to others; anthers versatile, sometimes with trichomes. Disk generally present, tubular, surrounding stipe of ovary; ovary with 1-12 or more ovules. Legumes dehiscent or indehiscent, winged or not; valves woody or papery. Seeds variously shaped, flat or round in cross section; testa hard or woody.
