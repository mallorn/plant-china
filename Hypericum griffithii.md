Leaves sessile; leaf blade ovate-oblong to ovate, (4-)4.5-11.7 × (2.7-)3.7-6 cm, thickly papery, abaxially not or scarcely paler, not glaucous; laminar glands large and small dots, abaxial glands absent; main lateral veins (6 or)7- or 8(or 9)-paired, uniting with midvein branches to form arched intramarginal vein, tertiary reticulation very dense, prominent adaxially at least, conspicuous; base cordate, apex obtuse-apiculate (or rarely acute) to rounded. Inflorescence 5-20-flowered, from apical node, round-topped, sometimes also from second node and on lower short lateral shoots, the whole then pyramidal; bracts caducous, lanceolate, small. Pedicels 0.8-2 cm. Flowers ca. 3.5 cm in diam., stellate; buds conic, apex acute. Sepals erect to outcurved in bud, ± spreading in fruit, ovate to lanceolate or oblong-elliptic, subequal, 2.5-5 × 1.5-2 mm, laminar glands few, streaks to dots, margin entire, apex acute to apiculate. Petals golden-yellow, obovate to oblanceolate, (1.3-)1.5-2 × 0.6-1 cm, 5-6 × as long as sepals; margin entire, eglandular; apiculus lateral, acute. Stamen fascicles each with 20-25 stamens, longest (0.8-)1.2-1.5 cm, 0.7-0.8 × as long as petals. Ovary narrowly ovoid to ovoid-ellipsoid, 4-5 × ca. 2.5 mm; styles erect, apically sometimes slightly spreading, 8-10 mm, 1.4-2 × as long as ovary, free but sometimes coherent in lower half.
