  "Reference": "Sphenocleaceae are only superficially similar to Campanulaceae s.l., and molecular data place them securely in the Solanales. They lack latex; the style is short and without hairs; there is no secondary pollen presentation; and fruit dehiscence is circumscissile, immediately inside the calyx.Sphenocleaceae are only superficially similar to Campanulaceae s.l., and molecular data place them securely in the Solanales.
