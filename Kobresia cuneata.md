## Description
Rhizomes short, thick, woody. Basal sheaths prominent, brown or dark brown, margins fibrillose, retaining dried leaf blades. Culms densely tufted, erect and stout, obtusely trigonous, (10-)15-45 cm tall, 1.5-2.5 mm in diam. Leaves basal, shorter than or ± equaling culms; blade filiform, 1-3(-5) mm wide, V- or U-shaped in cross section, midrib not distinct abaxially. Inflorescence a dense spike, sometimes interrupted at base, brown or dark brown, oblong to narrowly oblong, 2-6 × 0.5-1.2 cm; lowest involucral bract glumelike, apex aristate. Spikelets (except a few terminal ones that may be male only) bisexual with a basal female flower and (1-)3-7 distal male flowers; glumes brown or chestnut-brown, with yellowish green or green midvein, oblong, oblong-elliptic, or oblong-ovate, 5-6 × 2-3 mm, margin hyaline or not, apex obtuse or rounded and aristate; arista sinuate, 1-5 mm, margin hispid. Prophylls yellow or whitish yellow in lower part, brown above, oblong, 5-8 × 1.8-3 mm, papery, 2-keeled, keels smooth or very minutely scabrid, with up to 8 veins between keels, margins open to base, apex truncate. Nutlets yellow or yellowish brown, oblong, trigonous, 3-4.5 × 2-3 mm, very shortly stipitate, not or shortly beaked. Stigmas 3. Fl. and fr. May-Sep.
  "Reference": "This is like a robust form of *Kobresia schoenoides*, from which it is distinguished by its fibrillose sheaths; longer spikes; midribs of glumes broader, green, developed into an arista; and nutlets larger, narrower. In the description of *K. lepidochlamys*, the male flowers were misinterpreted as perianth scales. A specimen from Yunnan (*Rock 9600*) is intermediate between *K. cuneata* and *K. kansuensis*: it has the spicate inflorescence and fibrillose leaf sheaths of the former, but the very robust habit and flat leaves (midribs distinct abaxially) of the latter.This is like a robust form of *Kobresia schoenoides*, from which it is distinguished by its fibrillose sheaths; longer spikes; midribs of glumes broader, green, developed into an arista; and nutlets larger, narrower.
