Receptacle with numerous bristles. Corolla bluish or reddish purple, glabrous. Anther tails lacerate. Achene large, obtusely 4-angled, wrinkled, glabrous, apex with an obtusely crenulate crown.

  "Reference": "*Frolovia* is very closely related to *Aucklandia* (see note under that genus). In G. M. Shen (Fl. Xinjiang. 5: 273. 1999), the species of this genus is included in *Saussurea*. Molecular analysis by Y. J. Wang et al. (Ann. Bot. 99: 311-322. 2007) has shown that *Frolovia* and *Aucklandia* are more closely related to *Dolomiaea* than to *Saussurea*.*Frolovia* is very closely related to *Aucklandia* (see note under that genus).
