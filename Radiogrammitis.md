## Description
Plants small, epiphytic, seldom petrophytic. Rhizomes radial, with stipes in whorls; scales not clathrate, pale to dark reddish brown or yellowish brown, glabrous, sometimes absent. Stipe not articulate, phyllopodia absent. Lamina entire or rarely slightly crenulate; veins simple or 1- or 2-forked, free, endings sometimes with a hydathode on adaxial surface of lamina, or not. Sori superficial or slightly sunken in broad shallow depressions on lamina, on acroscopic vein branch unless fertile veins simple, in 2 rows, 1 each side of midrib. First-developed sporangia usually with 1-3 simple hairs at apex adjacent to annulus, rarely glabrous; later-developed sporangia glabrous. Hairs simple eglandular, either solitary or tufted.
