**Adinandra angustifolia** (S. H. Chun ex H. G. Ye) B. M. Bartholomew & T. L. Ming",

> The stamens in three whorls and a simple style place this species in *Adinandra* rather than in *Cleyera*. However, the seeds of the two genera are quite different and need to be examined when appropriate material becomes available.
