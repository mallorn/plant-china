  "Reference": "This species was described by Kurz as having pink flowers and a densely silky pubescent ovary; however, Sanjappa (Reinwardtia 10: 218-219. 1985) described it as having a glabrous ovary, and de Kort and G. Thijsse (Blumea 30: 112. 1984) described it as having whitish and yellow flowers and a strigose ovary. The Chinese specimens are without flowers. Two specimens from Thailand were recorded as flowering \"pinkish\" (*Kerr no. 5171*, K!) and \"yellow-white\" (*K. Larsen et al. no. 1912*, K!), respectively.This species was described by Kurz as having pink flowers and a densely silky pubescent ovary; however, Sanjappa (Reinwardtia 10: 218-219. 1985) described it as having a glabrous ovary, and de Kort and G.
