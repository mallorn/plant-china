60a.**Poa hirtiglumis var. hirtiglumis**",

> *Poa hirtiglumis* var. *hirtiglumis* is usually well marked by the possession of spikelets with glumes subequal to each other and subequal to or slightly longer than the first lemmas, the lemmas commonly pilose between the veins, and the paleas pilose for much of their length. Plants from the E Xizang-Qinghai Plateau sometimes lack the hairs between the lemma veins and on the palea keels.

## Description
Culms 1–1.6 mm in diam., nodes 1–2. Leaf sheaths smooth, glabrous, uppermost closed for 1/5–1/4 of length; ligule abaxially smooth, glabrous. Longest panicle branches 1.5–4.5 cm with 9–25 spikelets in distal 1/2. Spikelets 2.5–4.5 mm; rachilla internodes smooth, pilulose; upper glume 2.3–4 mm; lemmas 2–3.3 mm, keel densely villous for 4/5 of length, marginal veins for 2/3, surfaces pilulose, sparsely scabrid near obtuse apex; palea pilulose between keels, keels pilulose for most of length, distally scabrid.
