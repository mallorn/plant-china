2.**Munronia pinnata** (Wallich) W. Theobald",

> *Munronia pinnata* is a widespread species that varies greatly in character states, such as plant size, number and size of leaflets, leaflet margin, and inflorescence length. The broad interpretation used here largely follows D. J. Mabberley et al. (Fl. Males., Ser. 1, Spermat. 12(1): 30-34. 1995) and D. J. Mabberley (Rev. Handb. Fl. Ceylon 9: 236-239. 1995).&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Munronia hainanensis* var. *microphylla* is described on the herbarium label of the type specimen (*G. Q. Ding &amp; L. Yu 6795*) as having red flowers. This is most likely either a mistake or a misinterpretation of the color once the flowers were dried.

## Description
Shrublets (5-)10-50 cm, erect. Stems usually not branched, glabrous or apical part covered with appressed puberulence, glabrescent. Leaves odd-pinnate, usually aggregated apically on stem; rachis puberulent; petiole 1.5-4 cm, puberulent; leaflets (3 or)5-9(or more), 8-12 cm; leaflet blades oblong, ovate, elliptic, obovate, or suborbicular, 0.5-7.5 × 0.3-3 cm, basal ones smallest and increasing in size along rachis to apex with apical leaflet distinctly larger, membranous to thickly papery, abaxially sparsely puberulent but more densely so along veins, adaxially glabrous or very sparsely hispid between veins and puberulent along veins, secondary veins ca. 5 on each side of midvein and slender, base oblique and cuneate to rounded, margin entire or with sparse obtuse teeth or shallowly pinnately lobed; lateral leaflets subsessile, smaller than terminal leaflet, apex rounded, obtuse, or acuminate; terminal leaflet petiolulate, usually basally and apically more attenuate than lateral leaflets. Inflorescence axillary, 1- or few flowered in a raceme; peduncle 5-10 mm, puberulent. Pedicel to 5-12 mm, bracteolate, puberulent. Calyx 5-lobed to near base; lobes linear to lanceolate, 1.5-3 mm, apex acuminate. Corolla white; tube 1.3-4 cm, sparsely puberulent or glabrous; lobes alternate with anthers, oblong, oblanceolate, or lanceolate, 1-2 cm, apex acute. Staminal tube to 4 cm, slightly exserted, base adnate to corolla tube, apical margin with linearly lacerate teeth; anthers ellipsoid, ca. 1 mm, lanulose, apex acuminate. Ovary puberulent; style ± as long as filament tube, glabrous or basally puberulent. Capsule oblate, 6-7 mm in diam., sparsely stellate puberulent. Seeds yellowish gray. Fl. Apr-Nov.
