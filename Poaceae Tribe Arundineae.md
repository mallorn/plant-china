> The circumscription of this tribe is not yet settled. It is recognized here in the narrow sense, to include the tall, reedlike grasses with unspecialized spikelets, and their near relatives.

## Description
Perennials, mostly tall reeds, culms hollow. Leaf blades linear or broadly linear; ligule a line of hairs or membranous. Inflorescence an open or contracted panicle, often large and plumose with numerous spikelets. Spikelets laterally compressed, florets 2 to several, fertile with uppermost reduced, or lowest sterile, disarticulating above glumes and between florets, lowest persistent when sterile; floret callus truncate to linear, glabrous, laterally pilose or long-plumose; glumes persistent, variable in length, shorter than lemmas or as long as spikelet, membranous, 1–5-veined, apex acute to acuminate; lemmas narrow, rounded on back, hyaline to chartaceous, 1–7-veined, glabrous or plumose, apex acute or 2-toothed, awnless or a short straight awn arising from apex; palea short or subequaling lemma. Stamens 2 or 3. Caryopsis with hilum short or long-linear. Leaf anatomy non-Kranz; microhairs slender with long, narrow terminal cell. *x* = 9 or 12.
  "Statistics": "Four genera and ten species: one genus cosmopolitan, otherwise temperate Old World, but widely introduced elsewhere; three genera and six species in China.
