## Description
Culms usually rather tall and slightly stout. Leaf blades with transverse septate nodes. Involucral bracts leaflike, longer than inflorescence, usually not sheathed, rarely shortly sheathed. Spikes unisexual, several, few species with male flowers at top of female spike or with female flowers at top of male spike; 1-4 spikes at top of culm male, narrowly cylindric; remaining spikes female, single in involucral bract axil, oblong or cylindric, densely many flowered, usually shortly pedunculate. Female glumes oblong-lanceolate or narrowly ovate, muticous. Utricles obliquely patent, later rarely horizontally divaricate or deflexed, broadly ovate or ovate, inflated trigonous, membranous or subleathery, glabrous, distinctly veined, apex abruptly contracted into a short to long beak, orifice shortly 2-toothed or indistinctly toothed. Nutlets loosely enveloped in utricle, broadly obovate, trigonous; style slender, usually tortuous; stigmas 3.
