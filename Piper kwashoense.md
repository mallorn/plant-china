绿岛胡椒",
52.**Piper kwashoense** Hayata",

> This taxon has sometimes been named as &lt;I&gt;Piper philippinum&lt;/I&gt; Miquel (e.g., in Fl. Taiwan, ed. 2), following the account of Piperaceae in the Philippines by E. Quisumbing (Philipp. J. Sci. 43: 1-246. 1930). However, F. A. W. Miquel’s protologue of &lt;I&gt;P. philippinum&lt;/I&gt; (Syst. Piperac. 322. 1843) clearly excludes &lt;I&gt;P. kwashoense&lt;/I&gt; as described by Quisumbing because it refers to a plant with 5-veined leaves, lax female inflorescences 10-12 cm long, and ovoid fruits 4-5 mm long and apparently free from the rachis. The mistake seems to have come from Miquel, who based the protologue on a female plant, &amp;quot;&lt;I&gt;Cuming&lt;/I&gt; in herb. de Lessert 1642,&amp;quot; and then added a note that another collection, &lt;I&gt;Cuming 912&lt;/I&gt;, might be the male of the same species although it did have a number of differences. This latter collection is much more widely distributed in herbaria, and &lt;I&gt;P. philippinum&lt;/I&gt; has been interpreted as if &lt;I&gt;Cuming 912&lt;/I&gt; were the type.
