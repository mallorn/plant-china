> Molecular evidence would suggest that *Arundinaria* subg. *Sarocalamus* is possibly phylogenetically more closely related to *Phyllostachys*, even though it is morphologically closest to *A.* subg. *Arundinaria* from North America and *A.* subg. *Bashania*.

## Description
Small subalpine bamboos. Culms 1–3 m tall; internodes terete, smooth; nodes not swollen; supra-nodal ridge well developed. Branch buds on promontory; prophyll keels delicate, slightly ciliate. Branches initially 1–3, very erect, appressed, grooved, basal internodes progressively longer, often all long, lateral branching often distant from culm; complement proliferating to become broomlike. Leaf blade pale, linear-lanceolate, thin, matte, less than 12 cm. Inflorescence initially terminal or lateral to leafy branches, later in leafless branch complements; branches very erect, appressed, glabrous, branching subtended by long hairs, not pulvinate; glumes 1 or 2, both small, lower glume usually very small, usually distant from lower lemma, with vestigial remnants of subtended buds; palea keels ciliate.
