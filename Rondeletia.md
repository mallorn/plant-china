  "Reference": "This genus was formerly circumscribed broadly, to include as many as 140 species, but neotropical taxonomists now separate the species formerly treated in *Rondeletia* s.l. into a number of smaller genera, notably *Arachnothryx* Planchon and *Rogiera* Planchon. The cultivated species treated here belongs to *Rondeletia* s.s.This genus was formerly circumscribed broadly, to include as many as 140 species, but neotropical taxonomists now separate the species formerly treated in *Rondeletia* s.l. into a number of smaller genera, notably *Arachnothryx* Planchon and *Rogiera* Planchon.
