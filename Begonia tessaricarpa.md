174.**Begonia tessaricarpa** C. B. Clarke",

> *Begonia tessaricarpa* is a very rare and little-known species, represented only by the type gathering from Assam in  NE India. It is possible that its holotype represents a stunted plant of *B. roxburghii* A. Candolle. However, it is difficult to be certain because several important characteristics are lacking on this specimen (Mark C. Tebbitt, pers. comm., 2005). Shui et al. (Bot. Bull. Acad. Sin. 43: 322. 2002) cited, without description, a gathering from Mêdog in SE Xizang as *B. tessaricarpa*.
