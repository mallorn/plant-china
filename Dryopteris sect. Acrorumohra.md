17.**Dryopteris sect. Acrorumohra** (H. Itô) Li Bing Zhang & H. He",

> Plants terrestrial, medium-sized. Rhizome erect, short, clothed with scales; scales linear to linear-lanceolate or ovate, margin entire. Fronds tufted; stipe base scales like those of rhizome, becoming glabrous above; lamina broadly lanceolate, ovate, or pentagonal, (2 or)3- or 4-pinnate; ultimate pinnules or segments obliquely ovate or elliptic, without aristate teeth along margin or at apices, basal acroscopic segment often slightly auriculate, ± adnate to axes. Lamina herbaceous or papery, subglabrous on both surfaces; veins free, veinlets simple or 1(or 2) times forked, ending short of margin, tip not enlarged; arrangements of pinnules, segments, and veins anadromous throughout. Sori orbicular, terminal on acroscopic veinlet branches (occasionally subdorsal on veinlets); indusia reniform and entire, or absent; sporangia numerous, without glands on axes, annulus of 14-17 thickened cells. Spores ellipsoid; surface lophate. *x* = 41.Although *Acrorumohra* is sometimes treated as a separate genus, it is part of *Dryopteris* as resolved in a recent molecular study (Li Bing Zhang et al., BMC Evol. Biol. 12: 180. 2012).
