> The spelling \"luofuense\" was used in the protologue immediately above the diagnosis, whereas the accompanying key and illustration, and subsequent account by the same author in\nFRPS, used the spelling \"lofuense.\" The type locality was given in the protologue as \"Luofu Shan\"; the alternative \"Lofu Shan\" is Cantonese rather than Mandarin.
