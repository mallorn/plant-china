5.**Cycas segmentifida** D. Y. Wang & C. Y. Deng",

> Differs from &lt;I&gt;Cycas szechuanensis&lt;/I&gt; in its subterranean trunk, blue young petioles, and wider leaflets. As defined here, &lt;I&gt;C. segmentifida&lt;/I&gt; is close to &lt;I&gt;C. balansae&lt;/I&gt;, but is a wide-ranging, more northern species, differing in its blue young petioles, with much shorter spines, and its more numerous megasporophylls (30-50 together), with more lobes on the sterile blade.

## Description
Trunk subterranean, to 70 ×  70 cm above ground; bark dark brown, densely scaly. Leaves 15-25, 1-pinnate, 2-3.3 m ×  45-60 cm; petiole blue in 1st year, later green, 0.6-1.5 m, subterete, with 25-55 spines (1-)2-3.5 mm along each side, 1-2.5 cm apart; leaf blade oblong, flat, pale brown tomentose when young; leaflets in 55-110 pairs, longitudinally inserted 1-1.8 cm apart at 75-90&amp;#176;  to rachis, straight, 21-40 ×  1.2-1.8 cm, leathery, glabrous abaxially, midvein raised on both surfaces only when fresh, flat abaxially when dry, base decurrent, margin flat or somewhat undulate, apex attenuate, pungent. Cataphylls triangular, 7-9 ×  1.5-2.5 cm, densely pale brown tomentose, apex long, somewhat soft. Pollen cones yellow, narrowly ellipsoid-cylindric, 30-60 ×  5-12 cm; microsporophylls narrowly cuneate, 2-2.5 ×  1-1.2 cm, apex with short, upcurved mucro or nearly blunt.
