4.**Koeleria atroviolacea** Domin",

> This species is closely related to, and is sometimes regarded as a subspecies of, *Koeleria asiatica* Domin. That species, in the strict sense, is confined to arctic regions of E Europe, Russia, and W North America, and usually has densely hairy spikelets.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is uncertain whether this grass does in fact occur in China, as was reported in FRPS (9(3): 134, fig. 33. 1987, as *Koeleria asiatica*), or whether that record relates to an unusually loosely tufted form of *K. macrantha*. No specimens have been seen.

## Description
Perennial, shortly rhizomatous, forming loose mats; old basal sheaths papery, persistent. Culms erect or geniculate at base, 10–50 cm tall, pilose throughout length, 2–3-noded. Leaf sheaths of cauline leaves inflated; leaf blades green, flat or rolled, 5–15 cm, 1–2 mm wide, smooth or scabrid, occasionally pilose; ligule ca. 0.2 mm. Panicle rather lax, pyramidal to oblong in outline, 2.5–8 cm, lower part often interrupted, grayish violet. Spikelets 4–6 mm, florets 2 or 3; glumes usually glabrous, occasionally shortly ciliate on keel, lower glume narrowly lanceolate, 3.5–4 mm, upper glume broadly lanceolate, 4.5–5 mm; lemmas narrowly ovate, ca. 5 mm, smooth, glabrous, awnless, apex acuminate; palea keels scabrid.
