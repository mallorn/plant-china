51.**Hypericum subcordatum** (R. Keller) N. Robson",

> *Hypericum subcordatum* is very closely related to *H. monanthemum* subsp. *monanthemum* and resembles a small, delicate form of *H. monanthemum* var. *nigropunctatum* with leaves all petiolate and sepals apically acute and entire, characters that do not occur in combination in *H. monanthemum* itself. Along with the occurrence of both taxa on Emei Shan (Sichuan), where they remain distinct, these differences would appear to justify its separation as a species.

## Description
Herbs, perennial, 1-7 cm tall, erect from creeping and rooting base with stems unbranched or branched from upper 1(or 2) nodes. Stems with internodes 2-lined above, terete below, eglandular, slender. Leaves 1-1.5 mm petiolate; blade broadly elliptic or oblong-elliptic to obovate, 1-1.6 × 0.8-1.2 cm; thinly papery, abaxially paler (?or subglaucous); laminar gland dots pale, dense, small, or sometimes a few black, scattered; intramarginal glands black, dense or subirregular; main lateral veins 3-paired, tertiary reticulation rather dense, obscure; base cuneate to truncate or (uppermost) subcordate, margin entire, apex rounded. Inflorescence (1-)3-5-flowered, occasionally with branches from 1(or 2) nodes below, the whole flat-topped or bifurcating to subcylindric; bracts and bracteoles leaflike, margin entire. Flowers (0.8-)1-1.2 cm in diam., stellate; buds ?ellipsoid. Sepals free, erect in ?bud and fruit, oblong-lanceolate to lanceolate, subequal, 3-4.5 × 0.8-1.2 mm; laminar glands black, lines to (distally) dots; marginal glands black, few, sessile or submarginal, all or most distal; margin entire, apex acute; veins 5. Petals ?golden yellow, narrowly elliptic, 4.5-6 × 1-1.5 mm, 1.35-1.5 × as long as sepals; laminar glands black, few, lines to streaks; marginal glands black, few, subapical or absent; margin entire. Stamens 17-20, apparently 3-fascicled, longest 4-5.5 mm, ca. 0.9 × as long as petals. Ovary ellipsoid; styles 3(or 4), 1.7-2 mm, 0.85-1 × as long as ovary, divaricate-ascending. Capsule ovoid to subglobose, 4.8-6 × 3.5-4 mm, 1.5-2 × as long as sepals. Seeds yellow-brown, ca. 0.6 mm; testa finely scalariform. Fl. Jun-Aug, fr. Jul-Sep.
