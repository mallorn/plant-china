> About seven species: S and SE Asia, N India; four species (one endemic) in China.&#x0D;\n&lt;p&gt;&#x0D;\nThe number of species of &lt;I&gt;Engelhardia&lt;/I&gt; is open to question: more than ten have been recognized in SE Asia. The taxonomy of the genus suffers from a lack of good specimens from throughout its range.
