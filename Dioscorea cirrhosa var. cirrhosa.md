> Material from Taiwan is somewhat distinct in that most collections tend to dry greenish and the leaf blade has less prominent tertiary venation. They have been regarded as a distinct species, &lt;I&gt; Dioscorea matsudae,&lt;/I&gt; but there is no clear-cut distinction between this and typical &lt;I&gt; D. cirrhosa&lt;/I&gt; var. &lt;I&gt; cirrhosa,&lt;/I&gt; and so the former has been treated as a synonym of the latter. The affinities of &lt;I&gt; D. formosana&lt;/I&gt; are not clear. The type collections (B, destroyed) were originally identified as a variety of &lt;I&gt; D. rhipogonoides&lt;/I&gt; (var. &lt;I&gt; aculeata&lt;/I&gt; Uline, nom. nud.), which is a synonym of &lt;I&gt; D. cirrhosa&lt;/I&gt; var. &lt;I&gt; cirrhosa&lt;/I&gt;. Prain and Burkill examined this material and noted that it was too poor to name though probably not &lt;I&gt; D. cirrhosa&lt;/I&gt;. The protologue described a prominently prickly stem, a feature relatively unusual in &lt;I&gt; D.&lt;/I&gt; sect. &lt;I&gt; Enantiophyllum,&lt;/I&gt; so it is possible that at least part of the material might have belonged elsewhere.
