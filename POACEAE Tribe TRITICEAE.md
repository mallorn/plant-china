> In this account, \"first lemma\" refers to the lemma of the basal floret in a spikelet.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese genera of economic value include *Hordeum* and *Triticum* (staple foods) and *Agropyron*, *Elymus*, *Elytrigia*, and *Leymus* (fine forage).

## Description
Herbs annual or perennial, with or without rhizomes. Culms tufted or solitary. Leaf anatomy non-Kranz, without microhairs; leaf sheath usually split to base, rarely closed; ligule leathery or membranous; leaf blade usually linear to lanceolate, flat or involute. Inflorescence a solitary, bilateral spike, linear to ovate; rachis flattened, tough, or fragile and disarticulating at base of internodes, side not facing spikelets ± convex (here referred to as \"back\"). Spikelets 1 per node or in groups of 2 or 3 (rarely more) per node, usually sessile, rarely with a short pedicel, with 1 to many florets and apical floret smaller or sterile, laterally or dorsiventrally compressed, usually disarticulating below each floret if rachis tough. Glumes membranous to leathery, usually persistent, sometimes awnlike or reduced. Lemma 5–11-veined, apically awned or awnless. Palea with 2 keels. Lodicules 2, free, entire or 2-lobed. Stamens 3. Ovary tipped by a small, fleshy, hairy appendage. Stigmas 2. Caryopsis ellipsoid or oblong, hollowed on hilum face, free or somewhat adherent to lemma and palea. Endosperm with starch grains simple, rounded. Chromosomes large, *x* = 7.
  "Statistics": "About 20 genera and 330 species: temperate and warm-temperate regions, mainly in the N hemisphere; 13 genera (one introduced) and 175 species (99 endemic, eight introduced) in China.
