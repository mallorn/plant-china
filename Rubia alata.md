## Description
Climbers and vines, herbaceous, perennial; stems to 4 m, quadrangular, 4-ridged, or usually 4-winged at least when older with wings to 1.5 mm wide, glabrous or hirtellous-puberulent at nodes, retrorsely aculeolate. Leaves and leaflike stipules in whorls of 4, often unequal (stipules smaller); petiole 0.2-10 cm, on principal axes longer than on lateral ones, those of stipules often shorter or even lacking; blade drying thinly leathery, linear-lanceolate or narrowly lanceolate, 3.5-9 × 0.4-2 cm, with length/breadth index above 3, glabrous and smooth or sometimes sparsely scaberulous, base rounded to cordulate, margin thinly revolute and usually aculeolate, apex acute; principal veins palmate, 3(or 5) with lateral veins sometimes weakly evident. Inflorescences thyrsoid, paniculate, with terminal and axillary, many-flowered cymes; axes smooth to aculeolate, ridged to thinly winged; bracts elliptic to lanceolate-elliptic, 0.8-3 mm; pedicels 1-4 mm. Ovary ca. 0.7 mm, smooth. Corolla white, pale yellow, or greenish, campanulate, fused base 0.5-1 mm, glabrous; lobes triangular to lanceolate, 1.2-1.5 mm, apex caudate-acuminate. Mericarp berry black, 5-7 mm. Fl. May-Aug, fr. Aug-Nov.
  "Reference": "*Rubia alata*, an obvious member of *R.* ser. *Cordifoliae*, is here treated in the sense of H. S. Lo (in FRPS 71(2): 312, t. 70, f. 1-6. 1999), which may or may not correspond to its original application and its type. Accordingly, it is mainly characterized by relatively narrow leaves, petioles frequently bent near the base of the blade, stem angles with thin ridges to narrow or remarkably well-developed wings, and paniculate inflorescences, small flowers, and black fruit similar to other species of the *R. cordifolia* group (see additional comments under that species). The protologue of *R. alata* does not address the shape of the leaves and describes the stems as winged or not. This suggests the possibility that that the type’s leaves are not markedly narrower and its stems not more markedly winged than those of *R. cordifolia* and related species. *Rubia alata* was not treated by Deb and Malick (Bull. Bot. Surv. India 10(1): 1-16. 1968) for India, nor by Long (Fl. Bhutan 2(2): 823-825. 1999) for Bhutan. The Kew Rubiaceae checklist (Govaerts et al., World Checkl. Rubiaceae; http://www.kew.org/wcsp/rubiaceae/; accessed on 15 Sep 2010) considers it to be a synonym of *R. cordifolia* but gives no source for this conclusion. From the relatively abundant herbarium material studied and the rather narrow species concept used in the present treatment, we believe that it is justified to distinguish *R. alata* sensu H. S. Lo and *R. cordifolia* s.s.*Rubia alata*, an obvious member of *R.* ser. *Cordifoliae*, is here treated in the sense of H. S.
