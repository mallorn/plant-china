Leaf blade leathery, less often papery; abaxial surface scales dense, yellow to brown, large, unequal or all similar, often without hairs, sometimes pubescent along midrib; adaxial surface sparsely or densely scaly, scales unequal, often absent by maturity, hairs usually absent, rarely pubescent along midrib. Inflorescence terminal or subterminal, umbellate or shortly racemose, (1–)2–5(–10)-flowered; rachis 0.5–8 mm. Calyx undeveloped, 0.5–5 mm; corolla broadly funnelform-campanulate, lobed to middle, red to purple, white or yellow, rarely pale green or blue, sometimes with darker spots, with or without scales on outer surface, rarely hairy; stamens 10, unequal; ovary 5-locular, usually densely scaly, rarely also pubescent; style often longer than corolla, usually glabrous, rarely pubescent at base, not scaly. Capsule cylindric, 6–20 mm. Seed wingless.
