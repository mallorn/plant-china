> Recent evidence from DNA sequencing suggests that the two sections in *Rhododendron* subg. *Azaleastrum* are only distantly related; each may therefore merit subgeneric rank in its own right. For the most recent Chinese account of *R*. subg. *Azaleastrum* see Gao Lianming (Phylogeny of *Rhododendron* subg. *Azaleastrum sensu* Sleumer (Ericaceae). PhD thesis, Kunming Institute of Botany. 2002), who (pers. comm., 2004) reviewed the same subgenus in the present account.
