3.**Poa subg. Pseudopoa** (K. Koch) Stapf",

> Species of *Poa* subg. *Pseudopoa* have a delicate, annual habit and whorled, scabrid-angled panicle branches. The subgenus comprises two widespread, variable species, which are sometimes subdivided, and a few local species in SW Asia. Since 1934, they have usually been recognized as a separate genus, *Eremopoa*, but molecular data place them in the middle of *Poa*. *Poa persica* Trinius occurs from Turkey to Afghanistan and Pakistan, but has not yet been found in China. It can be recognized by its lemmas with broad, membranous margins and obliquely truncate tips in side view, and by having anthers 1.4–2.5 mm.
