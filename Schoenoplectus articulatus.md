## Description
Plants 30-85 cm tall (including involucral bract). Rhizomes shortly creeping. Culms densely tufted, 12-30 cm tall, 5-7 mm thick, terete, transversely septate, clothed at base with 1 or 2 bladeless leaf sheaths. Leaf sheaths 10-25 cm, terete, obliquely truncate at mucronate mouth. Involucral bract 1, erect, culmlike, usually longer than culm, with many transverse septate nodes. Inflorescence a pseudolateral head with many spikelets. Spikelets sessile, ovoid, 7-9 × 4-4.5 mm, many flowered. Glumes brownish yellow with dark brown lines, deltoid-ovate, 5-5.5 mm, concave, thinly membranous, veins many and ± conspicuous, apex with a costa excurrent into a mucro. Perianth bristles absent. Stamens 3; stigmas 3. Nutlet yellowish gray at maturity, obovoid, 2-2.2 mm, 3-sided, smooth. Fl. and fr. May-Jul.
  "Reference": "This species is widely distributed and very variable in the size of its vegetative parts. The Hainan plants were separated (as *Scirpus pseudoarticulatus*) mainly by their taller culms and relatively more pointed spikelets, but such features certainly fall within the variation range of *Schoenoplectus articulatus*.This species is widely distributed and very variable in the size of its vegetative parts.
