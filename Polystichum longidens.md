> *Polystichum longidens* is similar to *P. thomsonii*, but its lamina apex is shortly acuminate and its pinnae are longer, more deeply lobed, and glabrous on both surfaces.

## Description
Plants summer-green. Rhizome erect, short, together with basal stipe densely scaly; scales light brown, ovate or ovate-lanceolate, subentire, acuminate. Fronds 20-35 cm; stipe stramineous, 5-12 cm, ca. 2 mm in diam., distal stipe scales sparser toward rachis apex, linear-lanceolate. Lamina bipinnatipartite, light green when dry, elliptic-lanceolate, 20-35 × ca. 5 cm at middle, below middle gradually contracted toward base, acute or shortly acuminate; rachis stramineous, without proliferous bulbils, sparsely scaly abaxially; scales similar to distal stipe scales, light brown, linear-lanceolate. Pinnae 25-35 pairs, attached at nearly right angles to rachis or angled slightly acroscopically, alternate, approximate or slightly approximate, shortly stalked, deltoid-lanceolate, middle pinnae 1.5-2 cm × 6-8 mm at base, bases asymmetrical, acroscopic base auriculate, basiscopic margins truncate, pinnatifid to pinnatisect, apices acute. Lobes 6-8 pairs, angled upward; basal acroscopic auriculate lobes largest, elliptic, pinnatilobate; all remaining acroscopic lobes elliptic, pinnatilobate, forked or entire, apices acute and shortly spinulose; basiscopic lobes entire, apex acuminate and shortly spinulose; both surfaces glabrous; microscales absent, but if present then microscales brown, long acicular; frond texture thinly leathery; venation pinnate, slightly visible abaxially, indistinct adaxially, veinlets simple or forked. Sori terminal on shorter veinlets, 1 per lobe, but basal basiscopic 2 lobes sterile, 2 or 3 on auricles, close to midrib of pinnae, whole lamina fertile; indusia present, large, membranous, with shallow rounded teeth or erose, centers slightly concave, brown when mature.
