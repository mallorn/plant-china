> The lower glume of the sessile spikelet occasionally has very narrowly winged keels, but the narrowed, sharply bicuspidate apex is characteristic, differing from the more rounded lower glume apex of *Ischae-mum ciliare*. Axillary inflorescences are also uncommon in *I. ciliare*.

## Description
Annual or short-lived perennial. Culms slender, loosely tufted or stoloniferous, rooting at lower nodes, branching, flowering shoots 15–50 cm tall, nodes bearded. Leaf sheaths glabrous except toward throat, sometimes margins ciliate; leaf blades linear-lanceolate, 2–8 × 0.2–1 cm, glabrous or pilose with tubercle-based hairs, margins scabrid, base attenuate, apex acuminate; ligule 1–2 mm. Racemes terminal and axillary, paired (rarely 3), loosely arranged, 2–10 cm; rachis internodes and pedicels columnar, triquetrous, ciliate along angles. Sessile spikelet broadly elliptic, 3.5–6 × 1.2–1.5 mm; callus hairs 0.5–1 mm, white; lower glume smooth, glossy, leathery with rounded flanks in lower half, upper half papyraceous, prominently many-veined, asperulous, flanks keeled, keels scabrid, wingless, abruptly narrowed to bicuspidate apex; upper glume keeled above middle, keel wingless, apex narrowed into 2–4 mm awnlet; awn of upper lemma 1–1.6 cm. Pedicelled spikelet laterally compressed, resembling sessile, upper lemma awned.
