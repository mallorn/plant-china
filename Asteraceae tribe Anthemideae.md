## Description
Shrubs, subshrubs, or annual or perennial herbs, aromatic; indumentum of short biseriate glandular hairs (glands) and uniseriate simple, T-shaped or stellate hairs. Leaves alternate, rarely opposite, fasciculate or in basal rosettes, pinnatisect, pinnatifid, lobed, serrulate, serrate, or dentate, rarely entire, rarely succulent, base sometimes with stipulelike auricles (\"pseudostipules\"). Synflorescences mostly terminal, sometimes axillary, cymose or racemose, often paniculate, often flat-topped. Capitula heterogamous, with marginal female florets and central bisexual or male disk florets, or homogamous with only bisexual tubular florets. Phyllaries in 2-7 rows, overlapping, usually with scarious margin and apices. Receptacle paleate or epaleate, rarely pilose or hirsute. Marginal female florets radiate, or corollas tubular to filiform, often 2-toothed, or absent, and capitula disciform, fertile or sterile; corolla yellow or white, less often purplish, pink, orange, or red. Disk florets bisexual or male, tubular or funnel-shaped, usually yellow, rarely whitish, purplish, or red, usually 4- or 5-lobed. Anthers mostly rounded, rarely shortly tailed at base, apical appendage ovate or triangular to subulate. Pollen with or without spines. Style base slender or bulbous; style branches usually free (rarely fused in functionally male florets), usually linear, rarely wider, with apex truncate, penicillate. Achenes often obovoid, obconical, or cylindric, sometimes dorsiventrally flattened, apex rounded or truncate, true pappus absent, sometimes with a pappuslike corona of rather few scarious or bristlelike scales, or with an auricle, usually adaxial.
  "Reference": "This tribe includes well-known vegetables (*Glebionis carinata*, *G. coronaria*, and *G. segetum*) and famous ornamental plants (most notably *\"Chrysanthemum grandiflorum\"*; see note under *Chrysanthemum*). Insecticides are extracted from some species (e.g., *Tanacetum (Pyrethrum) cinerariifolium*). Other species are very important medicinally (e.g., *Artemisia annua*, the source of the important anti-malarial drug artemisinin) while some are significant forage plants in dry regions.This tribe includes well-known vegetables (*Glebionis carinata*, *G. coronaria*, and *G. segetum*) and famous ornamental plants (most notably *\"Chrysanthemum grandiflorum\"*; see note under *Chrysanthemum*).
