Bhutan 2(2): 756. 1999) the filaments are free. The Thai distribution is provisionally excluded here pending further study of the delimitation of this species.This species was reported from Thailand by Sridith (Thai Forest Bull., Bot. 27: 118. 1999) and as having filaments fused at their middles into a tube, but according to the Chinese specimens studied and descriptions of this species in other regions (e.g., Fl.
