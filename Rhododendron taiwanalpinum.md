台湾高山杜鹃",
505.**Rhododendron taiwanalpinum** Ohwi",

> This species was originally described as being allied to Rhododendron *oldhamii*, but it lacks the glandular indumentum of that species. Although *R*. *taiwanalpinum* is apparently a distinct species, the present authors’ knowledge of it comes from a single inadequate specimen and the type was not seen.
