Inflorescence erect; peduncle 10-13 cm, lacking sheaths; floral bract lanceolate, 18-22 mm, shorter than or almost as long as ovary, apex obtuse to acute. Flower solitary, rose-purple, tinged pale purplish blue, usually with a yellow center and dark purple spots on lip.

Petals narrowly oblanceolate, 30-32 × ca. 7 mm, apex acute; lip broadly ovate, 20-25 × 25-30 mm, usually ca. as broad as long, obscurely 3-lobed, apical margin erose, apex subacute; disk with 5-9 rows of papillae extending from base of lip and grading into lacerate lamellae midway along mid-lobe; papillae 1-1.5 mm tall.

  "Reference": "This species is very closely allied to *Pleione scopulorum* but differs in having a distinctive ovoid pseudobulb, smaller flowers with narrower, falcate petals, and a narrower lip with a subacute apex and a predominantly papillose rather than lamellate callus.This species is very closely allied to *Pleione scopulorum* but differs in having a distinctive ovoid pseudobulb, smaller flowers with narrower, falcate petals, and a narrower lip with a subacute apex and a predominantly papillose rather than lamellate callus.
