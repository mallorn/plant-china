4.**Hemarthria sibirica** (Gandoger) Ohwi",

> This is the only species in China with terete racemes, a transverse articulation line, and a truncate callus beneath the sessile spikelet. The racemes disarticulate at maturity more readily than those of the other species. In spikelet characters it is similar to *Hemarthria altissima*.

## Description
Perennial, with long creeping rhizomes. Culms usually solitary at rhizome nodes, erect, 1(–1.5) m tall, ca. 3 mm in diam., branched mainly above middle, nodes conspicuous, dark, glabrous. Leaf sheaths loose, compressed, lightly keeled, shorter to longer than internodes; leaf blades linear, 15–30(–40) × 0.4–0.8 cm, rather stiff, glabrous, narrowed or subcordate at base, apex acuminate; ligule 0.5–1.5 mm. Racemes solitary or fascicled, subterete, 6–10 cm, fairly stout, articulation line horizontal, disarticulating at maturity. Sessile spikelet slightly longer than adjacent internode, 5–8 mm; callus truncate, 0.4–0.8 mm; lower glume narrowly lanceolate, leathery, flat to subconvex on back, subapically slightly constricted, obtuse to emarginate; upper glume adnate to rachis, 4–7 mm, acute; lower floret 3.4–5.2 mm; upper floret 3.4–4.3 mm. Pedicelled spikelet 5.3–9.4 mm, both glumes slenderly acuminate. Fl. and fr. Jul–Oct. 2*n* = 18.
