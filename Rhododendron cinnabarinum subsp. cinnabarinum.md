122a.**Rhododendron cinnabarinum subsp. cinnabarinum** (Batalin) H. Hara",

> Two varieties have been recorded from China: var. *cinnabarinum* and var. *roylei* (J. D. Hooker) Hutchinson in J. B. Stevenson, Sp. Rhodod. 222. 1930; *R*. *roylei* J. D. Hooker, Rhododendr. Sikkim-Himalaya 1: t. 7. 1849 [“*roylii*”]). The latter taxon is distinguished by its deep plum crimson corolla. The populations of var. *cinnabarinum* in W Bengal, India, exhibit a range of corolla colors, from yellow or orange, through 2-colored forms, to deep cinnabar.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&lt;p&gt;*Rhododendron cinnabarinum* var. *purpurellum* Cowan (Notes Roy. Bot. Gard. Edinburgh 21: 147. 1951) has also been recorded from China and was accepted by Yang in FRPS (57(1): 136. 1999). However, Cullen (Notes Roy. Bot. Gard. Edinburgh 39: 124. 1980) treated it as a purple-flowered variant in the synonymy of *R*. *cinnabarinum* subsp. *xanthocodon* (*R*. *xanthocodon* in the present account).
