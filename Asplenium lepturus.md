37.**Asplenium lepturus** J. Smith ex C. Presl Epimel. Bot. 72. 1851.

> *Asplenium lepturus* is similar to *A. polyodon* but has more narrow and caudate pinnae, a widely creeping rhizome, and a peculiar perispore pattern. It shares these characters with a number of tropical taxa, e.g., *A. contiguum* Kaulfuss from Hawaii, the neotropical *A. serra* Langsdorff &amp; Fisher, the African *A. friesiorum* C. Christensen group, and *A. nitens* Swartz from Réunion.
