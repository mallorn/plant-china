  "Reference": "The frequent bistigmatic tendency found in Chinese plants has not been noted elsewhere in the range of the widespread circumboreal *Kobresia myosuroides*. A similar tendency (though to a lesser degree) is also found in Chinese *K. capillifolia*. Further work may confirm that specific rank for the bistigmatic \"Greater Tibetan\" taxon is more appropriate.The frequent bistigmatic tendency found in Chinese plants has not been noted elsewhere in the range of the widespread circumboreal *Kobresia myosuroides*.
