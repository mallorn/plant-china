小葶苈",
39.**Draba humillima** O. E. Schulz",

> &lt;I&gt;Draba humillima&lt;/I&gt; was first recorded from Xizang by Schulz in his monograph (p. 114). However, that record was overlooked in FRPS and Fl. Xizang. (vol. 2. 1985). The occurrence of the species in Xizang is here confirmed based on Strachey &amp; Winterbottom 2 (GH).
