二分果狐尾藻",
5.**Myriophyllum dicoccum** F. Mueller",

> *Myriophyllum dicoccum* was erroneously treated as *M. humile* (Rafinesque) Morong (*Burshia humilis* Rafinesque) in FRPS (53(2): 140. 2000). These taxa are separated by their fruit: *M. dicoccum* has 2-loculed fruit from female flowers and 4-loculed fruit from bisexual flowers on the same plant, whereas *M. humile* has only 4-loculed fruit.
