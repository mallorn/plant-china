## Description
Trees, unarmed; buds pyramidal to conical with stipules obvolute. Raphides absent. Leaves opposite, sometimes with domatia; stipules caducous, interpetiolar, generally triangular. Inflorescences terminal and in axils of uppermost leaves, capitate with several globose heads in fascicles or cymes, many flowered, pedunculate, bracteate; peduncles articulate; bracts often subtending heads; bracteoles filiform to filiform-clavate. Flowers sessile, bisexual, monomorphic. Calyx limb 5-lobed. Corolla color not noted, salverform to narrowly funnelform, inside glabrous; lobes 5, in bud valvate except apices subimbricate. Stamens 5, inserted in upper part of corolla tube, partially exserted; filaments short; anthers basifixed. Ovary 2-celled, ovules 4-12 in each cell, pendulous on axile placentas attached in upper third of septum; stigma globose to clavate, smooth, exserted. Fruit capsular, obconic, septicidally then sometimes loculicidally dehiscent into 2 or 4 valves from base to apex, woody to stiffly papery, with calyx limb persistent on persistent septum; seeds several, small, subglobose to trigonous or ellipsoid, unwinged.
  "Reference": "The taxonomy of this genus here follows Ridsdale (Blumea 24: 350-351. 1979), with a broader morphological variation as found in more recently collected specimens, in particular in inflorescence morphology. This taxonomy is complicated by varied application of the name *Adina polycephala*: Ridsdale treated this as a synonym of *Metadina trichotoma*, but older Chinese authors (in herb.) have long applied it to the plants treated here as *A. pubicostata*.The taxonomy of this genus here follows Ridsdale (Blumea 24: 350-351. 1979), with a broader morphological variation as found in more recently collected specimens, in particular in inflorescence morphology.
