> Although the type of &lt;I&gt;Cardamine bodinieri&lt;/I&gt; was collected from Guizhou (\"Kouy-Yang\" (Guiyang), May 1910, Bodinier s.n. (holotype, E)), the species was not mentioned in FRPS or in Fl. Guizhou. (vol. 7. 1989). The above record from Guizhou is also based on C. Z. Dang &amp; P. Dang 335 (PE).&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;Cardamine bodinieri&lt;/I&gt; is related to &lt;I&gt;C. fragariifolia&lt;/I&gt;, from which it differs by having 3-lobed, simple leaves (vs. trifoliolate, compound leaves with distinctly petiolulate leaflets), a broadly winged (vs. slender or narrowly winged) petiole, an amplexicaul (vs. entire) petiolar base, and petals without (vs. with) well-developed claws.&lt;P&gt;
