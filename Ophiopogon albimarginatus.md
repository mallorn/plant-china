> The present authors have not seen flowers of this species. Judging from the characteristics of the vegetative organs, it is similar to &lt;I&gt; Ophiopogon jiangchengensis&lt;/I&gt;. Detailed observation of the flowers is necessary in order to ascertain whether or not the two species are really distinct.
