> The Chinese species belong to three sections: *Poa* sect. *Macropoa* F. Hermann ex Tzvelev (species nos. 13–16); *P.* sect. *Poa* (species nos. 17–29), which is further subdivided into *P.* subsect. *Nivicolae* (Roshevitz) Tzvelev (species nos. 17–19), *P.* subsect. *Poa* (species nos. 20–22), and *P.* subsect. *Cenisiae* (Ascherson &amp; Graebner) V. Jirßsek (species nos. 23–29); and *P.* sect. *Homalopoa* Dumortier (species nos. 30–63).&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Poa raduliformis* (species no. 22) could not be included in Key 2 below because the taxon is insufficiently known to the authors. No specimens definitely referable to *P. raduliformis* were seen for this treatment.
