> *Dryopteris nodosa* has often been regarded to be conspecific with *“Acrophorus stipellatus”* (here recognized as a synonym of the following species, *D. paleolata*; see comment below), but *D. nodosa* has more finely dissected fronds, scabrous rachis, and larger indusia. Molecular data show that these two are not even closely related phylogenetically and should be separated from each other (Li Bing Zhang et al., BMC Evol. Biol. 12: 180. 2012).

## Description
Rhizome erect or ascending, short, ca. 2 cm in diam., terminal part densely covered with dark brown scales; scales ovate-lanceolate, ca. 1 cm, thickly membranous, sometimes with short fibriform hairs, entire or undulate, acuminate. Stipes tufted, stramineous, 30-45 cm, 5-8 mm in diam. at base, densely covered with scales same as on rhizome, subglabrous upward; lamina brown-green when dry, ovate, 50-80 × 46-80 cm, always quadripinnatifid, papery, glabrous or with few nodose hairs along midvein abaxially, sparsely covered with short nodose hairs adaxially, apex acuminate; pinnae 9-12 pairs, opposite, basal pairs 4-18 cm apart, basal pair largest, with short stalk 3-4 mm, spreading, narrowly ovate, 35-45 × 28-32 cm, tripinnatifid, base slightly enclosing rachis, apex acuminate; pinnules 12-16 pairs, basal one opposite and shortened, alternate upward, with short stalk 1-2.5 mm, upper pinnules slightly ascending, basiscopic pinnule longer than upper ones; ultimate pinnules 14-16 pairs, basal one opposite, alternate upward, subsessile, spreading, distant, narrowly elliptic, median ones longer, 2-3.4 × 0.8-1.5 cm, base truncate, close to rachillae, pinnatipartite to ultimate rachillae, apex acute or acuminate; lobes 6-8 pairs, spreading, close to each other, narrowly elliptic, 4-8 × 2-4 mm, base broadly cuneate, margin pinnatifid or undulate, apex rounded; veins obvious adaxially, pinnate on lobes, veinlets often simple, submarginal; rachis and rachillae stramineous, with narrow longitudinal groove adaxially, densely covered with nodose hairs at base, with 1 cordate brown scale. Sori orbicular, ca. 0.5 mm in diam., terminal on veinlet, 3-5 per lobe; indusium brown, semicircular or ovate-circular, membranous, attached at base, upper free margin somewhat erose.

> Semi-shaded roadsides, wet shaded slopes, forest margins; 1300-2300 m. Taiwan [Indonesia, S Japan (Kyushu), Malaysia, Philippines; Pacific islands (Fiji, Polynesia)].
