## Description
Herbs, perennial, 20-40 cm tall, glabrous. Rhizome horizontal, ± densely clad with persistent fleshy ovate petiolar bases and scales in 2 rows, when dried black-brown. Stems 1 to few, simple or branched, sometimes with detachable dwarf shoots in leaf axils late in season, with 2-4 scattered leaves. Radical leaves several; petiole 4-12 cm, sheathed; blade pruinose abaxially, green adaxially, deltoid or ovate to nearly orbicular, 3-6 × 3-6 cm, biternate; pinnae petiolulate; pinnules sessile, deeply biternatisect into oblong to oblanceolate obtuse lobes. Cauline leaves lowest long petiolate; upper shortly petiolulate to sessile; blade broadly ovate; lowest 3-5 × 3-5 cm, upward gradually smaller, biternate to bipinnate, like radical leaves. Raceme 3-4 cm, subcorymbose, 9-14-flowered; lower bract 20-30 mm, much divided into oblong lobes, progressively smaller and less divided upward; upper 8-15 mm, entire, oblanceolate. Pedicel straight, 15-30 mm in flower, 20-35 mm in fruit. Sepals ovate, 1-2 × ca. 1 mm, finely dentate. Petals pale blue to grayish blue, rarely white, inner petals whitish; outer petals without crest; upper petal 26-29 mm, broadly rhombic, apex shortly acuminate; spur broadly cylindric, 11-13 mm; nectary ca. 1/2 as long as spur; lower petal 14-18 mm with narrow claw abruptly widened into broad rounded entire limb; inner petals 13-15 mm. Stigma square, slightly emarginate; marginal simple papillae: median 2 distinct, lateral broad and confluent; geminate papillae lateral (submarginal) and on basal lobes. Capsule linear, 16-20 × 1-1.5 mm, 20-26-seeded (fruiting apparently very sparse in some predominantly vegetatively propagated populations); style ca. 4 mm. Seeds in 1 row, ca. 1 mm, smooth. Fl. and fr. Apr-Jun.

ssp. balsamiflora (Prain) C. Y. Wu, comb. nov. —— Corydalis balsamiflora Prain in Journ. As. Soc. Beng. 65: 41. 1896; et Nov. Ind. 161. 1905; H. Chuang et C. Y. Wu in Act. Bot. Yunn. 13(2): 130. 1991.

与原亚种的区别在于茎生叶少，且多生于茎上部；苞片大，叶状；花序少花，花较大，上花瓣长约3厘米。

产四川康定，生于海拔1950-2750米的水边。模式标本采自康定。

本亚种仅见于康定附近，见到的模式标本和宝兴产的C. flexuosa Franch.的模式显然有别如上述，不宜并入原亚种中。
