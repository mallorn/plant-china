> It has been suggested that *Angiopteris sparsisora* is of hybrid origin because it putatively is intermediate between *Angiopteris* and the formerly independent *Archangiopteris*, but this has not yet been proven to be the case. This species is, however, one of the reasons why it is difficult to draw a clear morphological distinction between the two genera, and (apart from the molecular evidence provided by Murdock, Amer. J. Bot. 95: 626-641. 2008) it is a further reason to merge *Archangiopteris* with *Angiopteris*.
