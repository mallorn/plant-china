瘦柱绒毛杜鹃",
268b.**Rhododendron pachytrichum var. tenuistylosum** W. K. Hu",

> This variety was wrongly cited in FRPS (57(2): 86. 1994) as var. “*tenuistylum*.” There is a case for treating it as a subspecies, rather than a variety, as it appears to have a more easterly distribution than var. *pachytrichum*.

## Description
Leaf blade subleathery, oblong-elliptic, 5–8.5 × 1.8–2.7 cm; base cuneate. Style to 4.5 cm. Capsule furrowed, densely tomentose.

> Forests; 2100–2200 m. Chongqing.
