## Description
Herbs, erect, twining, or prostrate, rarely trees. Leaves pulvinate, usually pinnately 3-foliolate, rarely 1- or 5-7-foliolate; leaflets entire or lobed, sometimes gland-dotted; stipules and stipels present. Inflorescence mostly axillary, racemelike, with fascicles of flowers scattered along an axis, sometimes reduced to solitary flowers or expanded into panicles, often with swollen nodes; bracts usually small, very caducous, rarely densely imbricate. Calyx 4- or 5-toothed, rarely truncate. Corolla papilionaceous; petals normal or keel long beaked or spirally twisted. Stamens diadelphous (9+1); vexillary filament usually free, or partly or completely connate with others into an adaxially split sheath; anthers usually uniform. Ovary with 1 to many ovules; style bearded lengthwise on adaxial side, or pilose only around stigma. Legumes 2-valved, partitioned or not between seeds, but not jointed. Seeds strophiolate or not.
