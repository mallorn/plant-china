> *Polystichum minutissimum* is similar in stature to *P. liboense*, which is also found in limestone areas of Libo Xian, Guizhou, but *P. liboense* is larger with lamina 6.5-10 × 1.2-1.6 cm and the middle pinnae ca. 9 × 4 mm. Most importantly, *P. liboense* has hydathodes near the margin of the pinnae, while *P. minutissimum* does not. Both species have nearly rectangular pinnae without spinules on margin.

## Description
Plants evergreen. Rhizome erect, 0.3-0.5 cm, sparsely covered with scales; scales brown, lanceolate, ca. 1.4 mm; roots 1-1.5 cm, ca. 0.23 mm in diam.

Lamina 1-pinnate, broadly lanceolate, 1.3-3.8 × 0.7-1.1 cm at middle, contracted toward base, apex obtuse; rachis 0.23-0.45 mm in diam. at middle, without proliferous bulbils; scales of rachis brown, dull, subulate to linear, 0.7-1.2 mm, varying in size, papery, margins ciliate, apices caudate. Pinnae 5-8 pairs, 2 basal pairs 2.3-4.8 mm apart, alternate, attached at ca. 70° angles to rachis, middle pinnae 2.9-5.8 × 2.8-4.5 mm, nearly rectangular, shortly stalked, acroscopic base auriculate, bases cuneate, margins bluntly toothed, apices obtuse; abaxially scaly, adaxially glabrous; microscales on abaxial surface linear, 1.1-2.9 mm; frond texture thinly papery; venation pinnate; midrib slightly raised abaxially, flat adaxially; lateral veins free, 2 or 3 pairs from midrib per pinna, slightly raised and nearly indistinct abaxially, indistinct adaxially.
