## Description
Prostrate or erect shrubs or small trees, glabrous, glandular papillate or covered with stellate, villous, or glandular simple or branched trichomes, often with embedded resin cavities protruding from vegetative and floral parts, viscid to resinous. Stipules absent. Leaves simple, alternate to densely spiral, more rarely opposite or whorled, sessile to petiolate; leaf blade margin entire, serrate, crenate, or rarely lobed. Inflorescences a reduced dichasial cyme of 1-12 axillary flowers; bracts absent. Flowers bisexual, rarely functionally male or female. Sepals (4 or)5(or 6-9), distinct, basally connate, or rarely forming a deep calyx tube, valvate or imbricate, ± persistent. Corolla bilabiate, campanulate, rarely urceolate, actinomorphic, or zygomorphic, 5-lobed, lower lip 1-3-lobed, upper lip 2-4-lobed. Stamens 4(-8), inserted in corolla tube, alternate with corolla lobes, included or exserted; filaments filiform; anther cells confluent, reniform or sagittate. Gynoecium of 2 connate carpels; ovary superior, 2-carpelled, becoming 4(-12)-loculed by division of ovary; ovules 1-3(or 4) per locule, pendulous, anatropous; stigma capitate. Fruit usually indehiscent, rarely semi-dehiscent or subschizocarpic, dry or drupaceous with fleshy or watery mesocarp; endocarp woody. Seeds with a straight or slightly curved embryo; endosperm absent or sparse.

Chinnock, *Eremophila* and allied genera: A monograph of the plant family Myoporaceae, 1-672. 2007), and *Pentacoelium* was re-instated as a genus distinct from *Myoporum* Banks &amp; Solander ex G. Forster. Although *Pentacoelium* is comparable vegetatively with species of *Myoporum*, the flowers are much larger and the fruit are quite different. The fruit of *Pentacoelium* are large and the most complex in the family. The fruit are similar in size and internal structures to *Bontia* Linnaeus, a genus endemic to the Caribbean and surrounding coastal areas of South America. Both genera show fruit features that suggest adaptation to dispersal by water, but the fruit of *Pentacoelium* are more complicated with a star-shaped inner woody zone and up to 10 locules and subapical lacunae extending down into the fruit.The family has recently been monographed (R.

3属，约230种，苦槛蓝属分布大洋洲至东南亚、美国夏威夷、毛里求斯，喜沙木属 Eremophila R. Br. 特产澳大利亚，单型的假瑞香属 Bontia L. 产西印度群岛及南美洲北部。南非产的 Oftia Adans. 和马达加斯加产的 Ranopisoa J. Leroy 分别被 R. Dahlgren 和 V. S. Rao（1971）及 D. J. Mabberley（1997）等移至玄参科，故苦槛蓝科在非洲没有分布。我国仅产苦槛蓝属1种，此外，假瑞香 Bontia daphnoides L. 在福建（厦门）和广东（广州）有零星栽培。

本科一些种可植作绿篱、花灌木，或作海滨及河岸多石地带的绿化材料。苦槛蓝属少数种在产地作药用或特殊用材。
