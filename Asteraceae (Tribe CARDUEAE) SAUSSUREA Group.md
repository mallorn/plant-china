## Description
Cauliferous herbs, stemless rosette herbs, or subshrubs, biennial, perennial, or rarely annual. Leaves without spines; leaf blade undivided to pinnatisect, margin entire or with blunt to mucronate non-pungent teeth. Capitula homogamous, bisexual. Phyllaries in several rows, without spines, apically sometimes with a green or purplish membranous or herbaceous appendage or mucronate. Receptacle densely covered with long subulate bristles, short scales, apiculate papillae, or naked and alveolate. Florets bisexual, all fertile. Corolla ± actinomorphic. Filaments distinct, glabrous. Style branches usually distinct and divergent, rarely partly coherent. Achene usually glabrous, sometimes glandular, rarely pubescent or papillose, apical rim inconspicuous or forming a ± developed crenulate or denticulate crown. Pappus homomorphic or heteromorphic, in 1 to several distinct or connate rows of scabrid to plumose bristles or rarely of small scales; inner pappus long, usually overtopping involucre.
