3a.**Torreya fargesii var. fargesii**",

> The record from S Anhui is based on &lt;I&gt;R. C. Ching 3036&lt;/I&gt; (E, K) from Huang Shan, a locality outside the main distribution area of &lt;I&gt;Torreya fargesii&lt;/I&gt;. This specimen was cited under &lt;I&gt;T. grandis&lt;/I&gt; by S. Y. Hu (Taiwania 10: 24. 1964), but is provisionally and tentatively placed under &lt;I&gt;T. fargesii&lt;/I&gt; here. However, it differs strikingly from the latter species in several features, and clearly deserves further investigation; the specimens seen are sterile and more material from the area would be required before a decision could be made as to their taxonomic status.
