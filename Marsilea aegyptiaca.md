## Description
Rhizomes creeping, with internodes up to 10 mm, but internodes frequently much shorter and fronds then appearing tufted; roots arising both at nodes and on internodes, short shoots of 1-3 mm frequently formed at nodes; longer shoots sparsely pubescent to glabrate, short shoots often densely pubescent with whitish to stramineous hairs up to 1 mm. Land fronds only seen, these with stipes green to straw-colored, 3.9-6.8 cm, slender, sparsely pubescent to glabrate; pinnae broadly clavate to obtriangular, 0.7-1.2 × 0.5-1 cm, sparsely pubescent to glabrate adaxially, appressed pubescent abaxially, margin entire or shallowly bilobed. Sporocarp 1 per frond, attached at base of stipe where stipe joins rhizome, but often persistent after frond decay and appearing to arise directly from rhizome; peduncle 5.7-8.3 mm, plus an additional 1-1.5 mm adnate to sporocarp, sparsely pubescent to glabrate; sporocarp brown, roughly quadrate in lateral view, 2.7-3.4 × 2.5-3.7 × 1.2-1.5 mm, soft leathery, concave on lateral sides, sulcate around perimeter, marked with a minute tooth ca. 0.1 mm above end of peduncle, densely appressed pubescent when young, especially in sunken lateral area, becoming thinly pubescent to glabrate with age.
