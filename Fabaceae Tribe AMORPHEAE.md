## Description
Small trees, shrubs, or herbs, with glandular punctae or pustules. Leaves paripinnate, imparipinnate, or less often pinnately to digitately 3-foliolate or 1-foliolate; stipels sometimes present. Flowers in racemes, spikes, or heads, terminating axis of origin (most becoming leaf-opposed). Calyx marcescent, upper lobes sometimes joined higher. Corolla papilionaceous, imperfect, or absent; lower petals often epistemonous, sometimes little differentiated. Stamens (5-)9 or 10, almost free to largely joined, usually monadel-phous; anthers usually uniform, sometimes gland-tipped. Ovary 1- or 2(-7)-ovuled. Legumes 1-seeded, indehiscent, continuous with recep-tacle and falling together with marcescent calyx. Seeds with small hilum.
  "Reference": "The Amorpheae was first thought to be most closely related to the Psoraleeae, but both molecular and morphological analyses now place it as sister to the Dalbergioid clade (e.g., McMahon &amp; Hufford, Amer. J. Bot. 91: 1219-1230. 2004).The Amorpheae was first thought to be most closely related to the Psoraleeae, but both molecular and morphological analyses now place it as sister to the Dalbergioid clade (e.g., McMahon &amp; Hufford, Amer.
