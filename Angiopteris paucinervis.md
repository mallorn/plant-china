10.**Angiopteris paucinervis** W. M. Chu & Z. R. He Cat. Type Spec. Herb. China (Suppl. II). 3. 2007.",

> The name *Angiopteris paucinervis* was originally published by Chu and He (Acta Bot. Yunnan. 22: 399. 2000) but not validly so because the type was not explicitly indicated (*Melbourne Code*, Art. 40.6). Later, Jin and Chen (loc. cit.) cited “*W. M. Chu et al.. ..... 18358*. (Typus: PYU),” provided a full and direct reference to He’s Latin description and diagnosis, and ascribed the name to “W. M. Chu et Z. R. He ex Z. R. He” thereby validly publishing the name, which should be attributed to W. M. Chu &amp; Z. R. He (Art. 46.2 and Note 2).
