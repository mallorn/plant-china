> *Asplenium caucasicum* is the diploid ancestor of the more common autotetraploid *A. septentrionale* (see below). This taxon is best known from the Caucasus region, but microcharacters have shown its presence in Xinjiang. A recent chromosome count from Xizang confirms its presence in China. A doubling of its genome has led to the origin of autotetraploid *A. septentrionale*. In places where both taxa grow together, their triploid sterile hybrid, *A. ×dirense* Viane &amp; Reichstein, can be expected.*Asplenium sasakii* (Hayata) Makino &amp; Nemoto was distinguished from *A. septentrionale* by its narrower fronds (a.o., Tagawa, Acta Phytotax. Geobot. 10: 204-205. 1941); it may be an earlier name for *A. caucasicum* if Taiwanese plants turn out to be diploid. However, at present, no chromosome counts or flow-cytometric data are available for Taiwanese plants.

## Description
Plants 8-15 cm tall. Rhizome shortly creeping to ascending, apex scaly; scales dark brown, narrowly triangular to subulate, entire to denticulate, at base fimbriate. Fronds caespitose; stipe shiny castaneous only at base, abruptly green toward rachis, 6-10 cm, 2-3 × as long as lamina, with unicellular glands or subglabrous, apex 2- or 3-forked; segments linear, 2-3 × 0.1-0.15 cm, base gradually decurrent onto stipe, minutely forked again at apex. Fronds without distinct rachis, green, other veins slender and subparallel to central axis, 1 veinlet per ultimate segment. Fronds herbaceous-leathery, grass-green. Sori 1-5 per segment, linear, 1-2 cm, on acroscopic veins and close to costa, at maturity covering entire surface; indusia brown, linear, membranous, free margin often with unicellular glands, entire-sinuate, opening toward main vein (costa), persistent but reflexed and covered by sporangia at maturity. Spores with lophate perispore, average exospore length 32-36 µm. Plants sexual diploid: 2*n* = 72.

> In crevices of non-calcareous (often granitic) rocks in open or partial shade; below 4100 m. ?Taiwan, Xinjiang, Xizang [Afghanistan, N India, Pakistan, Russia; SW Asia (Abkhazia/Georgia, Azerbaijan, Iran, Turkey), E Europe].
