羽萼蔷薇",
45.**Rosa pinnatisepala** T. C. Ku",

> Two forms may be recognized: f. *pinnatisepala*, which has hypanthium and sepals usually glabrous, and f. *glandulosa* T. C. Ku (Bull. Bot. Res., Harbin 10(1): 3. 1990), which has hypanthium and sepals densely glandular pubescent. One of us (Robertson) has seen no specimens of either form.
