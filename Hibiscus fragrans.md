9.**Hibiscus fragrans** Roxburgh",

> Handel-Mazzetti (Oesterr. Bot. Z. 87: 124. 1938) identified a gathering by Wissman, probably no longer extant, as *Hibiscus fragrans*. It has not been possible to confirm the presence of this species within China, but it does seem quite likely that it extends into our area.
