30.**Bambusa teres** Buchanan-Hamilton ex Munro",

> *Bambusa teres* is not recognized as a separate species in S Asia, where the name *B. nutans* subsp. *cupulata* is used instead, partially because the name *B. teres* was long overlooked, while this bamboo became widely known as *B. nutans*, the type of which, from Kathmandu in Nepal, represents a contiguous allopatric, very similar bamboo from the western Himalayas to E Nepal. The inclusion of *B. lixin* requires critical investigation.&#x0D;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This species was treated as *Bambusa tulda* in FRPS (9(1): 80. 1996).

## Description
Culms 8–20 m, 5–7 cm in diam., basally very straight, apically slightly drooping; internodes 40–46 cm, initially white powdery; wall thick; nodes flat, basal several with rings of gray-white silky hairs above sheath scar and with aerial roots; branching from basal node up. Branches several to many, clustered, central 3 dominant, lower branches bent downward, middle branches horizontal. Culm sheaths deciduous, convex, thickly leathery, initially white powdery, densely deciduously stiffly black strigose, later dark brown strigose, margin ciliolate, apex asymmetrically triangular; auricles obviously unequal, strongly undulate and wrinkled, larger ones conspicuously slanted downward to 1/3 of height of sheath, narrowly reniform or obovate-lanceolate, 4.5–5 × ca. 1.5 cm; oral setae curved; ligule 1.5–2 mm, entire, glabrous or very shortly ciliate; blade deciduous, nearly symmetrical, broadly triangular-ovate and acuminate, base broadly cordate and inflated, extending to both sides to join auricles for 1–1.3 cm, base ca. 5/8 as wide as sheath apex, abaxially glabrous, adaxially strigose or scabrous. Leaf blade broadly linear to linear-lanceolate, 15–20 × 1.5–2.5 cm, abaxially pale green, densely pubescent, adaxially glabrous or sometimes hispidulous near base. Pseudospikelets solitary or 2–5 clustered at each node of flowering branches. Spikelets linear to linear-lanceolate, 2.5–7.5 × ca. 0.5 cm; florets 4–6, apical 1 or 2 sterile; rachilla segments clavate, striate, apex ciliate. Glumes 1 or 2, many veined, apex acute; lemma ovate to oblong, 1.2–2.5 × ca. 0.8 cm, glabrous, many veined, margin ± slightly ciliate, apex acute or acuminate and finely tipped; palea slightly shorter than lemma, keels ciliate, 5–7-veined between keels, apex penicillate; lodicules 3, ca. 3.8 mm, anterior 2 thickened at base, 5-veined, margins long ciliate, posterior 1 not thickened at base. Anthers purplish red, 7.5–10 mm, apex obtuse or emarginate. Ovary obovate or ovate-ellipsoid, apex thickened and long hispid; style very short, long hispid; stigmas 3. Caryopsis ellipsoid, ca. 7.5 mm, apex long hispid.
