> The name *\"Qiongzhuea tumidinoda\"* (Hsueh &amp; T. P. Yi, Acta Bot. Yunnan. 2: 93. 1980) was not validly published because two types were indicated (see Hsueh et al., Taxon 45: 217–221. 1996 and Stapleton and Xia, Taxon 53: 526–528. 2004).&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The culms of this famous species have been used for walking sticks since the Han Dynasty; they are also used for umbrella handles, and the shoots are eaten as a vegetable.

## Description
Culms 2.5–6 m, 1–3 cm in diam.; internodes green, terete, 15–25 cm, grooved above branches, glabrous; wall thick, basal internodes nearly solid; nodes conspicuously enlarged into very prominent, raised discs. Branches (3–)5(–7) per node, subequal. Culm sheaths deciduous, oblong-elliptic, thickly papery, brown setose; auricles absent; oral setae 2–3 mm; ligule arched, 1–1.3 mm, densely gray ciliate; blade readily deciduous, erect, subulate or subulate-lanceolate, 5–17 mm, glabrous.
