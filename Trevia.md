滑桃树属
23.**Trevia** Linnaeus

> The genus name is most often given as *\"Trewia\"* but this is merely an orthographical variant of the original *\"Trevia\"* and there is no justification for its use without formal conservation.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kulju et al. (Blumea 52: 115-136. 2007) showed that *Trevia* is embedded within *Mallotus*, from which it differs only by the indehiscent fruit, and they transferred it to that genus, along with *T. polycarpa* Bentham, which they regarded as distinct. However, the name *Trevia* (1753) has priority over *Mallotus* (1790). For the sake of nomenclatural continuity, *Mallotus* should be formally conserved against *Trevia* because the former name is better known and has traditionally been applied to a much larger genus than the latter. The alternative would be many new combinations in *Trevia*. We are maintaining here the name *Mallotus*, which applies to a very easily recognized entity, until this nomenclatural issue is resolved.
