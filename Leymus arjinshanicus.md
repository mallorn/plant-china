> In the Chinese text of the protologue (p. 216) and in the illustration caption (p. 217), the specific epithet was spelled *\"aerginshani-cus*,\" whereas in the Latin text (p. 602) it was spelled *\"arjinshanicus*.\" Under Art. 61.3 of the Saint Louis Code, we here explicitly adopt *\"arjinshanicus\"* and reject *\"aerginshanicus.\"*
