Tuber dark brown, globose, ca. 7 cm high, to 8 cm in diam., weighing up to 850 g, developing seasonal offsets; offsets long, rhizomatous, ca. 9 cm, slender, ca. 0.8 cm in diam., not apically thickened. Leaf solitary; petiole background color dirty white or pale green with a very faint, pale brownish hue overlain with numerous tiny and fewer large, partly confluent, irregular, dark chocolate-brown or grayish spots, 10-95 cm, slender, to 2 cm in diam. at base, longitudinally, shallowly ridged; leaf blade green adaxially, moderately dissected, 10-150 cm in diam.; rachises only winged in distal 1/3; main segments subdichotomous; terminal segments oblong or lanceolate, base long decurrent in most distal ones, other segments narrowly sessile, 10-28 × 4-9 cm, apex acuminate. Inflorescence long pedunculate; cataphylls to 40 cm; peduncle colored as petiole, 30-70 cm, 0.8-2 cm in diam. at base. Spathe shortly convolute at base, outside pale greenish, grayish purple, or white, sometimes to base with whitish spots, or with gray-green or pale olive-brown spots, either only margin purplish red or also large parts reddish brown, inside pale greenish white with several irregular, purplish red spots and a purplish red margin, base inside often purplish red, or utmost base whitish, ovate or elliptic-ovate, concave, 7-26 × 4-16 cm, apex acute or obtuse, glabrous. Spadix white or with some pale brownish spots and a pinkish hue, much shorter than spathe, stipitate, 4-11 cm; stipe 0.2-1.5 cm, slender; flowers unisexual; female zone cylindric or slightly obconic, 1.3-3.5 cm, 0.8-2 cm in diam. (including styles), flowers congested; ovary dark purple with pale whitish green base, globose, depressed, or subpyriform, orbicular, diamond-shaped, or irregularly angulate in cross section, 1-2 mm high, 1.5-2(-3) mm in diam., ± gradually tapering to style but after fertilization developing an annular articulation, 1-loculed, occasionally 2-loculed, with 1 basal ovule per locule; style straight or ± strongly curved toward spadix axis, entirely dark purple or apical half bright pale green, slender, cylindric or slightly conic, apex oblique and sometimes tricuspidate or drawn out in a slender point reaching beyond stigma, 2-4 mm, ca. 0.8 mm in diam. at base; stigma subapical or lateral, superficial or subcapitate, usually transversely bilabiate, rarely longitudinally oval, shallowly but densely verrucate or echinate, occasionally with elongate, fleshy, conic verrucae, pale yellowish or dirty whitish, 0.5-1 mm in diam., 0.2-0.5 mm high; male zone cylindric to fusiform-obconic, 1.3-4 × 0.7-2.2 cm, flowers densely congested; male flowers consisting of 3-5 stamens; stamens 3-3.5 mm; filaments 1.8-2 mm, proximal half connate, whitish; anthers whitish, pinkish, or flesh-colored, elongate, subquadrangular or strongly biconcave in cross section, 1.3-1.5 × 1-1.3 mm, apex truncate; connective pale violet, massive; pores transversely elongate, lateral; appendix hardly to distinctly stipitate, globose, ovoid, elliptic, or conic, obtuse or truncate, at first turgid but during female anthesis weakening quickly and soon shriveling and drying, turning brown, 1-5 × 1-3 cm, with several irregular grooves (not associated with staminodes), longitudinal ones deepest, between usually with a complex and dense pattern of elongate, convolute staminodes, separated by narrow grooves, whole appearing brainlike, yellowish white or pale grayish green, occasionally with a pale violet hue; stipe of appendix cylindric or obconic, 0.1-0.6 × 0.3-1 cm. Infructescence cylindric, ca. 4 × 2 cm. Berries at first green, maturing orange, elliptic, 1- or 2-seeded. Fl. Mar-May, fr. Apr-Jun.
