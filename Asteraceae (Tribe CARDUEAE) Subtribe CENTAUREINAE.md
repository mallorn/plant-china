## Description
Herbs or subshrubs, annual, biennial, or perennial. Stems and leaves usually unarmed. Capitula homogamous or heterogamous; if capitula heterogamous then outer florets in 1 row, tubular, often enlarged and radiant, sterile or rarely female; inner florets in many rows, bisexual. Receptacle with dense whitish linear smooth setae. Corolla tube slender. Achene with or without an apical rim, glabrous or rarely hairy; attachment scar usually lateral. Pappus usually double (i.e., differentiated into 2 types of pappus elements); outer pappus elements bristlelike, usually in many rows and increasing in length from outermost to inner; inner pappus elements scalelike or bristlelike but wider than outer ones; or pappus simple and all pappus elements bristlelike or scalelike, rarely absent.
