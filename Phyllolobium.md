## Description
Perennial herbs with mostly well-developed stems, with basifixed hairs. Stipules free from petiole and from each other, very rarely shortly connate behind stem. Racemes several, with a distinct peduncle; bracts persistent. Bracteoles present or more rarely absent. Calyx campanulate. Standard wide, mostly suborbicular to transversely elliptic, with a very short claw, emarginate at apex; keel and wing petals not interlocking due to absence of bosses on keel and matching sockets on wings. Style with a brush of straight, rigid, short hairs just below glabrous stigma. Legumes 1-locular or incompletely to completely 2-locular.
