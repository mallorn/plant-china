3a.**Calystegia pellita subsp. pellita**",

> A seldom collected taxon with very few collections from China; most collections are from eastern Russia from Irkutskaya to Primorsk. One early specimen at Kew, labelled &amp;quot;Gehol, Chine/ Mongolie Orientale, &lt;I&gt;Abb&amp;eacute;&lt;/I&gt; &lt;I&gt;David,&lt;/I&gt;&amp;quot; cannot be placed with certainty in the provincial scheme for modern China. In 1955, the former province of Jehol was divided among Hebei, Liaoning, and Nei Mongol and it is unclear to which of these provinces the Abb&amp;eacute; David specimen should correctly be referred. Based on our very limited knowledge of this subspecies range, one would expect it to occur in Nei Mongol, and this province has been listed with a question mark. More collections are needed for this taxon. &lt;P
