> Based on molecular evidence (R. Sano et al., Molec. Phylogen. Evol. 15: 403-413. 2000; Wei et al., Acta Bot. Yunnan., suppl. 17: 46-54. 2010), the family Diplaziopsidaceae consisting of *Diplaziopsis* and *Homalosorus* Small ex Pichi Sermolli (and provisionally *Hemidictyum* C. Presl) was proposed by X. C. Zhang and Christenhusz (Phytotaxa 19: 15. 2011).
