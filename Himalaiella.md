Involucre hemispheric to campanulate. Phyllaries sometimes reflexed. Receptacle densely covered with subulate alveolate bristles and rarely also with subulate paleae. Corolla reddish purple, purple, pink, or white, gland-dotted. Anther tails moderately lacerate. Achene blackish, 2-5.5 mm, 4- or 5-angled, glabrous, wrinkled, squamulate, or muricate, apical rim forming a conspicuous crown.
