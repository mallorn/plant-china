Inflorescence solitary, long pedunculate; cataphylls as with leaf; peduncle colored as petiole, 13-60 cm, 1-2 cm in diam. at base. Spathe shortly convolute at base, erect, concave, arching over spadix, outside white or pale greenish white, rarely dark green, sometimes near base with paler, occasionally ringlike spots, or sometimes flushed with pale pinkish, margin sometimes lined pinkish, inside pale greenish white without spots; limb outside dirty creamish, sometimes with faint spots, margin sometimes pale pinkish violet, inside ± cream-colored or pale greenish white, margin sometimes pale pinkish violet, broadly ovate, 9-29 × 4-20 cm, inside base glabrous or with a few scattered, punctiform warts, apex obtuse or acute.

Infructescence cylindric or subglobose, 4-11 × 3.5-5 cm, dried male zone and appendix often remaining, as well as dried spathe.
