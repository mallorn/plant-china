  "Reference": "Based on the description of this species as having 5 corolla lobes, fully exserted anthers, and subcapitate stigmas, as well as its general aspect, this species seems better placed in *Tarenna* than *Ixora*. The protologue did not describe the number of ovules per ovary locule, which is not a significant character in *Ixora* and probably thus was not checked.Based on the description of this species as having 5 corolla lobes, fully exserted anthers, and subcapitate stigmas, as well as its general aspect, this species seems better placed in *Tarenna* than *Ixora*.
