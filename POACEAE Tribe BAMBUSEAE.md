1.**POACEAE Tribe BAMBUSEAE**",

> Woody bamboos are found extensively in most of southern, central, and southwestern China and are also found in northern China as far north as Beijing. They have been a significant natural resource throughout China's history, providing food and raw materials for construction and manufacturing. Domestic and exported bamboo products remain important to China's national economy. Cultivation of bamboos of Chinese origin on a commercial scale in other countries is currently restricted to immediately neighboring countries, but is likely to expand. Many Chinese bamboos are of importance in western horticulture, and numerous species with horticultural potential remain poorly known.&#x0D;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The taxonomy of China's bamboos still remains in a largely unrevised state. The majority of the species has been described since 1980, frequently without knowledge of the flowers, due to the often very long flowering cycles (up to 150 years). Generic delimitation has often been highly speculative and remains controversial. The large number of endemic species, along with the susceptibility of their natural forest habitats to destruction or degradation, and their inherent inability to reproduce and disperse, make the group of particular conservation concern. *In situ* conservation is essential because of the infrequent flowering of bamboos and the short viability of bamboo seeds. There is a pressing need to refine the classification of Chinese bamboos, to ascertain conservation status, and to safeguard threatened species.&#x0D;\n&lt;p&gt;&#x0D;\nMany taxa described as forms are not known in the wild, and they would be more appropriately known as cultivars. They often represent clones with variegated leaves or colored culms, selected for ornamental purposes. These arise spontaneously among the normal population, with a tendency to appear around the time of flowering, and others appear as abnormal seedlings. Such names are largely excluded from this account, and only the more important cultivars are mentioned in comments.

## Description
Rhizomes pachymorph (branching sympodial) or leptomorph (branching monopodial). Culms perennial, woody, diffuse (culms solitary), pluricaespitose (culms in a series of clumps connected by rhizomes) or unicaespitose (culms in a single dense clump), self-supporting, scrambling, or rarely climbing; internodes usually hollow, terete, or quadrangular, sometimes flattened or grooved above branch clusters; nodes level or raised at supra-nodal ridge or sheath base, basal nodes often with ring of aerial roots or rarely with hardened root thorns. Culm branches solitary to very many densely fasciculate at nodes, basal branch sheathing often reduced, bud scales variously derived, reduced, or absent. Leaves on most of culm except apex usually deciduous, modified into culm sheaths with a supportive and protective role:sheath thickened, blade much reduced, thickened, generally not photosynthetic; oral setae often well developed, on auricle margins when auricles present. Foliage leaf sheath with interior ligule and a less distinct external ligule, often with well-developed auricles and/or oral setae; blade deflexed, broad, roughly linear-lanceolate, base narrowed into pseudopetiole, articulating and eventually separating from persistent sheath, transverse veinlets often forming distinctly tessellate venation. Inflorescences (more correctlysynflorescences) aggregations of sessile florets in spikelets or pseudospikelets, branching absent to compound, bracteate or ebracteate; spikelets prophyllate or not, glumes often poorly distinguished from basal bracts and lemmas, not subtending viable buds or branches (semelauctant), or in pseudospikelets subtending axillary buds capable of partial or extensive spikelet ramification (iterauctant); lodicules absent to very many, usually 3, usually ciliate, veined, posterior lodicule usually narrower than anterior pair. Stamens usually (2 or)3(or 4) or (5 or)6(or 7), rarely very many. Style short or long; stigmas 1–3. Fruit usually a dry caryopsis, sometimes succulent with a thickened, fleshy pericarp. Several South American genera are morphologically rather more diverse.
  "Statistics": "About 88 genera and ca. 1400 species: Asia, South America, Pacific Islands, N Australia, Africa, especially Madagascar, Central and North America; 34 genera (five endemic, one introduced) and 534 species (469 endemic, three introduced) in China.
