Annuals, terrestrial or lithophytic. Rhizoids and stolons capillary, simple. Traps on rhizoids and stolons, shortly stalked, ovoid, ca. 1 mm, mouth lateral; appendage 1, dorsal, flabellate, fringed with multicellular stipitate glands. Leaves few, rosulate at peduncle base, long petiolate, glabrous; leaf blade obovate, 2-8 × 1-1.5 mm, rather fleshy, veins dichotomously branched, base attenuate, margin entire, apex rounded. Inflorescences erect, 1-5 cm, 1-3-flowered, glabrous; peduncle terete, 0.3-0.4 mm thick; scales absent; bracts basisolute, oblong, 0.6-1.2 mm, base truncate, apex obtuse to acute. Pedicel spreading at anthesis but decurved and distally thickened in fruit, terete, 1-5 mm, filiform; bracteoles basisolute, similar to bracts. Calyx lower lobe oblong, much smaller than upper lobe, apex entire, emarginate, or erose; upper lobe orbicular to broadly transversely elliptic, 1-1.5 mm, apex deeply emarginate. Corolla white or pale mauve, with a yellow spot at base of lower lip, 2-5 mm; lower lip 3-lobed, middle lobe much longer than lateral lobes, apex rounded to emarginate; spur cylindric, slightly longer than upper calyx lobe, straight or almost so, apex obtuse; palate with a slightly raised rim fringed with short hairs; upper lip subquadrate, much shorter than upper calyx lobe, apex shortly 2-lobed. Filaments ca. 0.5 mm, slightly curved; anther thecae distinct. Ovary globose; style very short; stigma lower lip circular, upper lip obsolete. Capsule globose to obliquely ovoid, 1.5-2 mm, dehiscing by a single longitudinal ventral slit. Seeds ovoid, 0.7-0.9 mm, distal end with a tuft of short hairs ca. 1/2 as long as body of seed; seed coat with regular longitudinal rows of acute papillae. Fl. Jul-Sep, fr. Aug-Oct.
