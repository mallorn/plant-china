Sori orbicular, terminal on basal acroscopic veinlets of lobes or ultimate pinnules; indusium semicircular or cup-shaped, membranous, inferior, attached by broad base, enclosing sori when young; receptacle elevated; annuli longitudinal and interrupted, consisting of 14-16 thickened cells, with long stipe; spores narrowly elliptic, with coarsely ribbed epispore. *x* = 41.
