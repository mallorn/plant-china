26.**Poa qinghaiensis** Soreng & G. Zhu",

> *Poa qinghaiensis* differs from other species in *P.* subsect. *Cenisiae* by the combination of the lemmas lacking villous hairs, being scabrid on the lower sides, and in having pronounced intermediate veins. Specimens were previously treated under the name *P. lipskyi* or remained unidentified. Although not well studied in *P. hissarica* or *P. lipskyi*, vestigial anthers are common in the new species and have not been found in other species in *P.* subsect. *Cenisiae*. In many respects, *P. qinghaiensis* approaches *P. pagophila*, but that species generally has smaller spikelets and the glumes are strongly papillate. Intermediates between *P. qinghaiensis* and *P. calliopsis* have been found at the Kunlun Pass and presumably represent hybridization between them.

## Description
Perennials, tufted, with or without short rhizomes; shoots extravaginal and intravaginal. Culms few to several, erect (5–) 15–55, nodes 1–3, 0–2 exserted, uppermost to 1/4–1/2 way up, base enclosed in few to many layers of old pale brown sheaths. Leaf sheaths smooth or the lower ones coarsely scabrid, glabrous, 2–15 cm, 1.5–3 × as long as blade, uppermost closed for 1/2 of length; blades flat or folded, moderately thin, 2–10 cm × 2–3(–5) mm, abaxially smooth or scabrid, adaxially scabrid, of tillers to 20 cm; ligules 2–4 mm, abaxially smooth. Panicle open or loosely contracted, 2–10 × 1.5–6 cm, longest internodes 0.4–2.1 cm; branches spreading to reflexed, sinuously flexuous or arched, (1 or)2(–4) per node, rounded and smooth or distally sparsely scabrid and slightly angled, longest 1–6 cm with 2–6 spikelets clustered in distal 1/3, clusters frequently pendent; flowers female or perfect, sometimes whole inflorescences female. Spikelets ovate, purple tinged, 5–9(–10) mm, florets 2–4; vivipary present or commonly absent; rachilla internodes 0.5–1(–1.2) mm, smooth, glabrous; glumes subequal, smooth or keel sparsely scabrid, lower glume 3.5–6 mm, 1- to faintly 3-veined, upper glume 4–7 mm, 3-veined; lemmas (4–)4.5–7.5 mm, veins 5(–9), intermediate veins distinct, apex acute, keel and veins scabrid, hooks fine to coarse, sometimes elongated, occasionally developed into short villous hairs in the lower 1/3, surfaces proximally moderately to densely scabrid, distally moderately to sparsely scabrid or minutely bumpy; callus glabrous; palea scabrid between keels, keels densely scabrid. Anthers 2–3 mm, or vestigial. Fl. and fr. Jul–Aug.
