假石柑属",
3.**Pothoidium** Schott Aroideae. 26. 1856.",

> One species: China (Taiwan), Indonesia (Maluku, Sulawesi), Philippines.

## Description
Shrubs, climbing. Branches extra-axillary. Leaves simple, distichous, petiolate; petiole elongated, leaflike, flattened, veins parallel; leaf blade triangular-lanceolate, short, with parallel veins. Inflorescences in axil of leaves; bractlike cataphylls 1 or 2. Spathe deciduous, short. Spadix cylindric. Flowers bisexual but plants functionally dioecious; tepals 6, with vaulted-truncate apex; stamens 3-6, anthers oval, longitudinally dehiscent; ovary obovoid, 1-loculed, ovule solitary, subbasal, stigma sessile. Berry ovoid, acute. Seed oblong, without endosperm.
  "Reference": "*Pothoidium* is similar to *Pothos repens* but differs in being functionally dioecious, by the branching inflorescences, and by its unilocular ovary and solitary ovule. *Pothoidium* has functionally unisexual spadices arranged seemingly in panicles and maturing sequentially. The structure of the fertile shoots is not yet clearly understood; however, it is possible that they are developed by the reduction of all the leaves of a leafy fertile shoot system to minute prophylls and cataphylls and that the panicle-like synflorescence is hence to be regarded as an aggregate structure. *Pothos repens* and *Pothoidium* are vegetatively almost identical. Depauperate flowering specimens of *Pothoidium* greatly resemble robust plants of *Pothos repens*. Interpretation of *Pothoidium* inflorescences suggests that *P. lobbianum* is functionally dioecious. \"Male\" spadices have flowers with prominently visible anthers and an apparently sterile ovary. \"Female\" spadices have flowers with a large unilocular fertile ovary and no stamens. Flowers of *Pothos* species are always bisexual with a 3-locular ovary.*Pothoidium* is similar to *Pothos repens* but differs in being functionally dioecious, by the branching inflorescences, and by its unilocular ovary and solitary ovule. *Pothoidium* has functionally unisexual spadices arranged seemingly in panicles and maturing sequentially.

**7.假石柑属——Pothoidium Schott**

Schott in Osterr. Bot. Wochenbl. 7: 70. 1857.

攀援灌木。分枝腋上生。叶二列，叶柄极伸长，叶状平展，扩大，全部脉平行，叶片短三角状披针形，脉与叶柄脉相连。花枝腋上生，具叶，上部具苞片；花序柄单生叶腋和苞腋，有苞片1或2枚。佛焰苞短或不存在；肉穗花序圆柱形，生于序柄之顶端。花两性和雌性，花被片6，先端拱状内弯。两性花：雄蕊3，花丝长于花被片，渐狭为药隔，花药短，药室卵圆形，超出药隔，外向纵裂；雌蕊扁球状，无花柱。雌花：假雄蕊3，与花被近等长，有时较短，雌蕊卵圆形；子房1室，胚珠1，珠柄短，由基底一侧上举；无花柱；柱头无柄，脐状突起。浆果卵圆形，锐尖；种子长圆形，无胚乳。

单种属。分布于印度至马来西亚。

本属与石柑属Pothos特别是与百足藤P. repens外形极相似，但子房1室，胚珠1。
