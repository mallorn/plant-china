## Description
Climbing woody vines. Stems almost glabrous or with very sparse fine but rather stiff short hairs, more dense at nodes and on young stems. Leaves 26-31 cm; petiole up to 13 cm, with sparse fine stiff hairs; stipels slender, ca. 5 mm; leaflets thinly papery, adaxially almost glabrous or sparsely strigose, lateral veins 5-7 pairs, gently curved; terminal leaflet broadly ovate or triangular-cordate, 12-15 × ca. 11.5 cm, base cordate, apex acute; lateral leaflets ca. 15 × 11 cm, width ratio of abaxial to adaxial halves 1.7:1, base shallowly cordate or almost trun-cate. Inflorescences on old stems (flowers not known). Calyx with short dense spreading light brown stiff hairs outside. Leg-ume narrowly oblong and slightly downcurved, narrowed to base and apex and distinctly indented transversely between seeds, ca. 9.5 × 2 cm, ca. 1 cm thick, leathery, densely pubes-cent like calyx on most of surface and clothed with reddish brown irritant bristles; both margins with a pair of wings up to 4 mm wide but of irregular width giving slightly jagged outline, both surfaces with 16-25 slightly obliquely transverse thinly textured winglike lamellae of irregular height up to ca. 3 mm high, sometimes interrupted or branched. Seeds ca. 5, black or brown, with irregular striations or spots, almost spherical, ca. 12 × 11 mm, ca. 9 mm thick; hilum black, length ca. 1/2 of seed circumference.
  "Reference": "*Mucuna cyclocarpa* is distinctive in its large cordate leaflets and almost spherical seeds. Its small narrow legume with irregular surface lamellae resembles only that of *M. lamellata*, which differs in the markedly laterally flattened seeds, the legume scarcely indented be-tween the seeds, and the leaflets cuneate at the base and usually smaller.*Mucuna cyclocarpa* is distinctive in its large cordate leaflets and almost spherical seeds.
