> This new species is named for its small inflorescences, with unbranched lateral branches which become progressively shorter toward the inflorescence apex, thereby giving a conic appearance. Chinese material has hitherto been confused with *Boehmeria* *polystachya*, which can be distinguished from *B*. *conica* by its narrower leaves with serrate margins and many transversely parallel secondary veins, much more irregular and rebranched inflorescences, and narrowly rhomboid-obovoid fruiting perianth tube with a cuneate base.&#x0D;\n&lt;p&gt;&#x0D;\nAlso see CHEN, C.

## Description
Shrubs large, to 3 m tall, dioecious; branches 4-angled; branches and petioles sparsely appressed strigillose, glabrescent. Leaves opposite, subequal in size; stipules narrowly triangular, 3-4 × 1.5-5 mm, connate at base; petiole 4-12 cm; leaf blade light green abaxially, dark green adaxially when dried, ovate-orbicular to suborbicular, rarely broadly ovate, sometimes obliquely ovate, 8-17 × 6.5-14 cm, herbaceous, basal veins extending into apical 1/5 of leaf blade, secondary veins 3 or 4 each side of midvein, reticulate veins slightly raised abaxially, abaxial surface subglabrous, adaxial surface sparsely adpressed strigose, glabrescent; base cordate, rounded truncate or broadly cuneate, margin crenate, apex cuspidate to shortly acuminate, rarely acuminate, tip entire. Glomerules 5-10-flowered, on axillary, regularly spreading branches along specialized flowering shoots 5-8 cm; branches simple, spikelike, progressively and regularly shorter toward apex of shoot. Male flowers 4-merous, sessile; perianth lobes elliptic, ca. 1.2 mm, sparsely puberulent, connate to middle. Fruiting perianth tube broadly ovoid, compressed, ca. 0.8 mm, sparsely strigillose on shoulder, base ± rounded, apex with very short neck. Fl. Oct-Mar, fr. Apr-Jun.

> Forests, shady wet places in ravines; 1200-2000 m. SE Xizang, Yunnan [NE India (Bengal)].
