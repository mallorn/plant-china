> The type of *Rhododendron torquatum* L. C. Hu closely resembles *R*. *watsonii*, sharing with that species a flattened, winged petiole, a white, compacted leaf indumentum, and a glabrous ovary. The latter species, which belongs to *R*. subsect. *Grandia*, differs in having a 6- or 7-lobed corolla. If *R*. *torquescens* indeed has a 5-lobed corolla, as described in the protologue of *R*. *torquatum*, then it is probably correctly placed in *R*. subsect. *Taliensia*.
