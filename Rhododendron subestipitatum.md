单花无柄杜鹃",
487.**Rhododendron subestipitatum** Chun ex P. C. Tam",

> This species was treated as a synonym of *Rhododendron championiae* in FRPS (57(2): 365. 1994); it may be distinguished by the usually 1-flowered inflorescence, the non-sticky buds, the shorter pedicels (ca. 5 mm), and the pink corolla. The specific epithet was misspelled “*subespitatum*” on p. 90 of the protologue, but was spelled correctly in the caption of the line drawing on p. 97.
