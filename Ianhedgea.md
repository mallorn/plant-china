Basal leaves petiolate, not rosulate, finely pinnatisect or 3-sect; lobes 3 or 5, filiform, linear, narrowly oblong, or oblanceolate-linear, sparsely to densely dendritic. Cauline leaves shortly petiolate, similar to basal leaves in division and pubescence, reduced in size upward and becoming trifid. Racemes few to several flowered, ebracteate; rachis strongly or rarely slightly flexuous. Fruiting pedicels slender, sometimes thickened and nearly as wide as fruit, erect or divaricate. Sepals oblong, erect, base of lateral pair not saccate. Petals white or pink, longer than sepals; blade oblanceolate, apex obtuse; claw obscurely distinct from blade. Stamens 6, tetradynamous; filaments filiform; anthers broadly ovate, apex obtuse. Nectar glands confluent, subtending bases of all filaments. Ovules (6-)10-20 per ovary. Fruit dehiscent siliques, linear, terete, torulose, divaricate or appressed to rachis, sessile; valves papery, veinless or with an obscure midvein, glabrous or minutely dendritic; replum rounded; septum complete; style absent or obsolete; stigma capitate, entire. Seeds uniseriate, wingless, oblong, plump; seed coat nearly smooth, not mucilaginous when wetted; cotyledons incumbent.
