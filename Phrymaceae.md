## Description
Herbs, annual or perennial [or subshrubs to shrubs], erect, prostrate, creeping to ascending. Stems 4-angular or winged or terete, occasionally highly reduced. Stipules absent. Leaves simple, opposite; leaf blade margin serrate or entire or variously toothed. Inflorescences a terminal [or axillary] spike [or a terminal raceme or a cyme] or flowers solitary and axillary. Flowers perfect, with [or without] a bract and a bracteole. Calyx connate, 5-lobed or dentate; lobes usually less than 1/3 of calyx length. Corolla connate, tubular or cylindric, 2-lipped; lower lip with 3 imbricate lobes; upper lip 2-lobed. Stamens [2 or]4, inserted in corolla tube or exserted, anterior 2 longer; anthers longitudinally dehiscent. Gynoecium of 2 connate carpels; ovary superior, 1- or 2-locular; stigma broadly 2-lobed to 2-lipped, receptive only on inner surface and close together upon contact. Fruit an achene (in *Phryma*), loculicidal capsule (e.g., in *Mimulus* Linnaeus) [or occasionally berrylike (in *Leucocarpus* D. Don)]. Seeds numerous, rarely to 1, with an oblong embryo; endosperm scanty.

Yu Li (in FRPS 70: 314-317. 2002) treated Phrymaceae to include only the genus *Phryma*, but recent studies have shown that the family should include a number of genera previously considered to be part of Scrophulariaceae. For China Phrymaceae now includes *Mimulus* with five species (four endemic), which has already been treated for the *Flora of China* in Scrophulariaceae (D. Y. Hong &amp; N. H. Holmgren, Fl.

科名模式：透骨草属Phryma L.
<p style='text-indent:28px'>仅1属，1种，2亚种，间断分布于北美东部及亚洲东部；我国东北、华北、陕西、甘肃南部、四川及其以南（海南、台湾除外）各省区有1亚种。
<p style='text-indent:28px'>G．Bentham和J．D．Hooker（1876）、H．Baillon（1892）、J．Hutchinson（1926）、A. Cronquist（1981）等学者主张将透骨草属归入马鞭草科Verbenaceae。
