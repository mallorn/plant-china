One of us (Kramina) has seen no specimens similar to *L. alpi-nus* among the material studied from China. Probably some mountain forms or varieties of *L. corniculatus* sensu lato exist in China, but these do not seem close to those from C Europe or even Turkey, where *L. al-pinus* is otherwise distributed. This problem needs additional study using both morphological and molecular-genetic methods.In FRPS (42(2): 224, 226. 1998), *Lotus alpinus* (Seringe) Schleicher ex Ramond (Mem. Mus. Hist. Nat.
