50.**Festuca cumminsii** Stapf",

> The name *Festuca cumminsii* is used here in a broad sense to include a number of segregate taxa that can be grouped together as the *F. cumminsii* aggregate. The aggregate is characterized by intravaginal branching, leaf sheaths closed for more than half their length, and leaf sclerenchyma in 3 small strands. *Festuca cumminsii* s.s. is known only from Bhutan and India (Sikkim). Taxa in the aggregate that occur in or very near China are as follows.

## Description
Plant loosely or densely tufted; shoots intravaginal. Culms 4–45 cm tall, nodes 1–3. Leaf sheaths glabrous or pubescent; auricles acute erect swellings or absent; leaf blades conduplicate, (1.5–)5–10(–14) × 0.2–0.4 mm, 0.5–0.8 mm deep, veins 5–7(–9); adaxial to abaxial sclerenchyma strands absent, abaxial sclerenchyma in 3 narrow discrete strands; ligule 0.1–0.4 mm, margin ciliolate. Panicle contracted to spikelike, 2–10 cm; branches stiffly ascending to erect, 1 at lowest node. Spikelets 5–10 mm, greenish, brownish or purplish; florets 2–6; glumes often ciliolate on margins; lower glume narrowly lanceolate; upper glume lanceolate to broadly lanceolate; lemmas 3.2–6 mm, scabrid; awns 0.8–3 mm; palea keels scaberulous or scabrid. Anthers (0.8–)1–3 mm. Ovary apex glabrous. Fl. and fr. May–Sep.
