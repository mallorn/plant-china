7.**Sporobolus diandrus** (Retzius) P. Beauvois",

> *Sporobolus diandrus* and *S. fertilis* are elements of the polymorphic, pantropical species complex of *S. indicus* (Linnaeus) R. Brown. This complex includes a range of intergrading taxa encompassing chromosome numbers from 2*n* = 18 to 2*n* = 54. Due to the small differences between these taxa and the frequency of intermediates, they are sometimes regarded as varieties of a broadly defined *S. indicus*.

## Description
Perennial. Culms tufted, erect, 30–90 cm tall. Leaf sheaths glabrous but margin ciliate; leaf blades linear, usually involute, 5–30 × 0.2–0.3 cm, glabrous on both surfaces or adaxial surface distinctly pilose at base, tapering to a long filiform apex; ligule 0.2–0.3 mm. Panicle contracted or rather loose, 7–35 × 1.5–3.5 cm; branches 1.5–9 cm, ascending or obliquely spreading, loosely spiculate, often lower 1/3 bare. Spikelets silvery grayish or yellowish green, 1.4–1.7 mm; lower glume oblong, ca. 0.5 mm, veinless, truncate or obtuse; upper glume oblong-ovate, 1/2–2/3 spikelet length, obscurely 1-veined, acute or obtuse-erose; lemma ovate-oblong, as long as spikelet, indistinctly 1 (–3)-veined, acute to obtuse. Anthers 2(–3), 0.5–0.8 mm. Grain obovate to oblong, 0.6–0.9 mm, apex truncate. Fl. and fr. May–Aug. 2*n* = 24.
