12.**Ophiopogon jiangchengensis** Y. Y. Qian",

> This species is similar to &lt;I&gt; Ophiopogon siamensis&lt;/I&gt; M. N. Tamura (Acta Phytotax. Geobot. 49: 27. 1998), from N Thailand, but differs in having longer bracts and shorter filaments and style. &lt;I&gt; Ophiopogon siamensis&lt;/I&gt; has bracts less than 1 cm, filaments 0.7--1.1 mm, and style 5--5.4 mm. Further studies are needed to ascertain whether or not these two species are really distinct.
