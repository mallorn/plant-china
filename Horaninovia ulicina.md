> *Horaninovia* *minor* Schrenk (in Fischer &amp; C. A. Meyer, Enum. Pl. Nov. 1: 11. 1841) has been reported from Xinjiang (Tacheng) by Grubov (Rast. Tsentral. Azii 2: 100. 1966), based on a specimen collected in 1840 by Schrenk “near Chuguchak” and preserved at LE. No specimen has been seen by the present authors. It differs from *H*. *ulicina* in having leaves and bracts arcuate curved, perianth wingless, and anthers with a linear appendage.
