36.**Draba korshinskyi** (O. Fedtschenko) Pohle",

> The first record of &lt;I&gt;Draba korshinskyi&lt;/I&gt; from Xizang was made by Hedge (Fl. Iran. 57: 181. 1968) and later confirmed by Tolmachev and Junussov (Fl. Tajik. 5: 194. 1978). The above first record from Xinjiang is based on Qinghai-Xizang Team 870482 (HNWP, KUN) and Xinjiang Team 1368 (WUK).
