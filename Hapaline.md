Spadix subequal to or longer than spathe, slender; female zone adnate to spathe, few flowered (2-7), ± biseriate, separated from male zone by short sterile zone; male zone subulate to cylindric, fertile to apex or with a few sterile flowers at apex or with a long, terminal appendix [*Hapaline appendiculata* Ridley]. Flowers unisexual, naked.
