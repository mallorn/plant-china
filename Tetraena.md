四合木属",
3.**Tetraena** Maximowicz",

> B.-A. Beier et al. (Pl. Syst. Evol. 240: 11-39. 2003) proposed a new phylogenetic system in the subfamily of Zygophylloideae based on molecular and morphological data. This treatment recognized 40 species under the genus *Tetraena*, most of which were new combinations transferred from the genus *Zygophyllum*. According to this concept, *Tetraena* is distributed from Africa to Asia in a very wide range, which contrasts with the traditional concept that recognizes *Tetraena* as a unispecific genus endemic to Nei Mongol.
