## Description
Herbs 20-90 cm tall, perennial. Rhizomes very short. Stem solitary, erect, apically branched and glabrous or with white, stiff, subulate, and partly glandular hairs. Basal and lower leaves with winged clasping petiole to 10(-15) cm; leaf blade narrowly obovate to elliptic, 4.5-16 × 1.5-6 cm, pinnatipartite to pinnatisect or lyrately so, glabrous, margin entire or with few larger teeth; lateral lobes 2-7 pairs, lanceolate, elliptic, or linear, recurved, apex acute to obtuse; terminal lobe triangular-ovate, ovate-sagittate, linear, or lanceolate, apex acute to obtuse. Middle and upper stem leaves shortly petiolate or sessile; leaf blade elliptic to lanceolate, smaller, narrower, and less divided than lower leaves, base sagittately to auriculately clasping. Synflorescence paniculiform, with numerous capitula. Capitula with 10-12 florets. Involucre narrowly cylindric, (8-)9-10(-12) × 3-4 mm. Phyllaries glabrous or with subulate hairs, apex acute to obtuse; outer phyllaries triangular-ovate to linear-lanceolate, longest ca. 3/4 as long as inner phyllaries; inner phyllaries 8. Florets blue to purplish blue, rarely white. Achene 4-5 mm; body dark reddish to blackish brown, ellipsoid, compressed, with broad lateral ribs; beak greenish to brownish, 1-1.5 mm, slender. Pappus double, outer hairs ca. 0.2 mm, bristles ca. 7 mm. Fl. and fr. Jul-Sep.
  "Reference": "*Chaetoseris albiflora*, with white florets and strongly recurved leaf lobes, recently described from Xizang, hardly deserves recognition as a separate taxon and is here placed in the synonymy of *Cicerbita roborowskii*. Another recently described species from Xizang and based on a single 19th century collection, *Chaetoseris potaninii* is said to be closely related to *Cicerbita roborowskii* but to have a strongly reduced outer pappus and leaves with only 1-3 pairs of lateral lobes each with 1 or 2 large teeth. As the division of the leaves in *C. roborowskii* shows some variation, this feature, although conspicuous, does not preclude conspecificity of *Chaetoseris potaninii*, neither does the stated pappus feature. A closer inspection of the material is pending, but for the time being *C. potaninii* is included in *Cicerbita roborowskii*. As no discontinuity could be observed between plants having leaves with narrow (linear to linear-lanceolate or narrowly elliptic), ± entire lateral and terminal lobes on the one hand and those having leaves with wider (broadly lanceolate to ovate), 1- or 2-toothed lobes (originally described as *Lactuca prattii*) on the other hand, the inclusion of this latter species starting with Beauverd in 1910 is therefore maintained.*Chaetoseris albiflora*, with white florets and strongly recurved leaf lobes, recently described from Xizang, hardly deserves recognition as a separate taxon and is here placed in the synonymy of *Cicerbita roborowskii*.
