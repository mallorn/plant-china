> *Lepisorus kawakamii* has often been treated as a synonym of *L. megasorus*. The two species can be distinguished as follows: in *L. kawakamii* the lamina is linear-lanceolate, the rhizome scales are usually ovate or acuminately ovate with entire margins, and the paraphyses are small, thin, and pale brown, while in *L. megasorus* the lamina is lanceolate, widest near the base, the rhizome scales are lanceolate with denticulate margins, and the paraphyses are relatively large, thick and brown. Sometimes, the scales in *L. kawakamii* are lanceolate, but the linear-lanceolate lamina, thin paraphyses, and much closer sori are reliable markers for this species.

## Description
Rhizome long creeping, 2-3 mm in diam., with scales caducous, mainly at apex and near phyllopodia; scales ovate or acuminately ovate, 1-1.2 × 1-1.1 mm, basifixed, margin entire, apex acuminate; lumina uniformly small. Fronds 0.5-1.5 cm apart; stipe 7-15 cm, 1.5-2 mm in diam.; lamina linear-lanceolate, 25-40 × 1-2 cm, widest at or below middle, leathery or softly leathery, scales orbicular or lanceolate; veinlets obscure. Sori medial or sometimes nearer margin, 3-4.5 mm in diam.; paraphyses orbicular, 0.5-0.7 mm in diam., usually very thin.

> ● On tree trunks in forests; 1700-2700 m. Taiwan.
