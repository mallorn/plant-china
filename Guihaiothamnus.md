## Description
Subshrubs, unarmed; roots woody and stout. Raphides presumably absent. Leaves opposite, often congested or apparently fascicled at stem apices, without domatia; stipules caducous, apparently interpetiolar, triangular. Inflorescences terminal or pseudoaxillary, congested-cymose or subcapitate, several flowered, sessile to shortly pedunculate, bracteate with bracts linear. Flowers shortly pedicellate or subsessile, presumably bisexual, with biology unknown. Calyx limb deeply 5-lobed. Corolla pink, salverform with tube slender and abruptly expanded in throat, inside pubescent; lobes 5, convolute in bud. Stamens 5, inserted in corolla throat, partially exserted; filaments short to reduced. Ovary 2-celled, ovules numerous in each cell on fleshy, peltate, axile placentas; stigma 2-lobed with lobes capitate, exserted. Fruit purplish red, baccate, fleshy, subglobose, with calyx lobes tardily deciduous; seeds numerous, small, angled, reticulate.
  "Reference": "The relationships of this genus and some of its morphological details are unknown. The presence or absence of raphides has not been explicitly noted; absence is here inferred based on H. S. Lo’s (in FRPS 71(1): ix. 1999) classification of this genus in Rondeletieae, but the one specimen seen has scattered raphidelike structures deep within some intact tissues.The relationships of this genus and some of its morphological details are unknown.
