黄药白花荛花",
48b.**Wikstroemia trichotoma var. flavianthera** S. Y. Liou",

> The protologue of this variety emphasized the presence of yellow anthers but there is rather little information on anther color within the genus, including *Wikstroemia trichotoma*, and available images of Korean material also show flowers with yellow anthers. However, the apparently much larger calyx and isolated distribution do suggest that this taxon is worth maintaining.
