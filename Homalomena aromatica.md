Leaves several together; petiole pale to mid-green with slightly darker longitudinal streaks, to 35 cm; petiolar sheath persistent, 4-7 cm, margins membranous; leaf blade mid-green, drying distinctively pale green, ovate-sagittate to elliptic-sagittate or lanceolate-sagittate, 20-30 × 10-17 cm, thinly leathery, base sagittate, sinus broad, ca. 5 cm, apex acute to long acuminate, with a tubular mucro ca. 2 mm; venation variously differentiated, posterior costae with 4-6 primary lateral veins arising ± simultaneously, anterior costa with 4-6 primary lateral veins and a similar number of virtually indistinguishable interprimary veins diverging from midrib at 45°, secondary venation striate. Inflorescences 1 or 2 together; peduncle erect (developing and floral) to declinate (post-anthesis and fruiting), colored as petiole, 10-18 cm. Spathe oblong, 8-10 cm; limb gaping at anthesis, then closing again. Spadix tapering cylindric, 7-9 cm, subequaling spathe, stipitate; stipe ca. 5 mm; female zone 1.5-3 × ca. 1 cm; ovary pale green, ovoid-globose, ca. 2 mm in diam., with an associated clavate staminode subequaling height; stigma sessile, capitate; staminode ivory-colored; male zone 5.5-6 × ca. 0.5 cm; male flowers white, rhombic-hexagonal in apical view, 1-2 mm in diam., each comprising 2 stamens overtopped by a large connective. Infructescence when ripe shedding spathe by slightly ragged basal abscission. Berries ripening dull orange yellow, smelling of overripe plums.
