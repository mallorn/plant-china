## Description
Herbs, subshrubs, or shrubs. Stems generally with fibers in phloem, without resin canals. Leaves alternate, rarely opposite, usually entire and tomentose at least abaxially. Capitula heterogamous disciform or homogamous discoid, rarely heterogamous radiate, solitary or variously grouped. Phyllaries generally papery, generally brightly colored or hyaline and with a thickened, cartilaginous basal portion (stereome) composed of compact sclerenchyma. Receptacles generally epaleate or paleate. Female outer florets generally filiform or often absent. Central florets generally bisexual, sometimes functionally male. Anthers ecalcarate, with tails; endothecial tissue almost always polarized. Pollen with 2-layered ektexine comprising an outer columellate layer and an irregularly interlaced basal layer. Style branches with hairs apically, rarely dorsally; stigmatic rows generally separated. Achenes small, oblong to obovoid, usually hairy; pericarp generally with 2, 3, or 5 vascular bundles. Pappus generally of plumose or barbellate to scabrid capillary bristles, occasionally of bristles and scales, only scales, or absent.
