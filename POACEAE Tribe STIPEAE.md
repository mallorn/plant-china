7.**POACEAE Tribe STIPEAE**",

> The number of genera that should be recognized in *Stipeae* is still controversial. Sometimes a broad view is taken of *Stipa*, but in Asia it has usually been broken into segregate taxa. This traditional treatment is followed here, with a few exceptions, to avoid the creation of many new combinations while the taxonomy is still unsettled.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the first four small genera are of uncertain tribal placement. These are little known, undercollected grasses from the Himalayas and W China. They are sometimes placed in *Aveneae*, but on balance show more Stipoid characteristics, including multiveined glumes, an unkeeled palea, often 3 lodicules, and a linear hilum.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lemma measurements refer to the lemma body and the callus together.

## Description
Perennials, usually forming tussocks. Leaf blades linear to filiform, often convolute or folded; ligule membranous, margin often ciliolate. Inflorescence an open or contracted panicle, sometimes spikelike, spikelets all alike. Spikelets with 1 floret (to 3 in *Duthiea*), terete or laterally compressed, disarticulating above glumes; rachilla extension usually absent (present in *Stephanachne*, *Sinochasea*, and *Duthiea*); glumes equaling or longer than floret, persistent, hyaline to membranous, 1–7-veined; floret callus obtuse to pungent; lemma rounded on back, membranous to leathery, firmer than glumes, often indurated at maturity, 3–9-veined, often enclosing palea, apex entire or 2-toothed, awned from apex or between teeth; awn straight or geniculate, glabrous, pubescent or plumose; palea subequal to lemma, hyaline to membranous, usually 2-veined (5–7-veined in *Psammochloa*) but not keeled, apex usually acute. Lodicules 2 or 3. Stamens mostly 3 (1 in *Stephanachne monandra*), anthers sometimes bearded with apical tuft of short hairs. Stigmas 2 or 3. Caryopsis fusiform, tightly enclosed by lemma and palea; hilum linear; embryo short.
  "Statistics": "Between nine and 17 genera: temperate and warm-temperate regions; ten genera (one endemic) and 67 species (17 endemic) in China.
