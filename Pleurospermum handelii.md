高山棱子芹",
36.**Pleurospermum handelii** H. Wolff",

> This incompletely known and problematic species is recorded only from a few collections (none bearing mature fruit). It is possibly better placed in *Physospermopsis* on account of the fibrous stem base, long slender rays, and green young fruit, but is here retained in Pleurospermum pending further research.
