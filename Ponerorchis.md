## Description
Herbs, terrestrial, small to medium-sized, slender. Tubers subglobose, ovoid, or ellipsoid, not divided, fleshy. Stem usually erect, terete, glabrous, with 1-3 tubular sheaths near base and 1-5 leaves above. Leaves basal or cauline, alternate or rarely subopposite, basally contracted into clasping sheath, glabrous to sparsely pubescent. Inflorescence terminal, glabrous or pubescent; rachis laxly or densely 1- to many flowered; floral bracts lanceolate to ovate. Flowers resupinate, secund or not, small to medium-sized; ovary twisted, often slightly arcuate, glabrous or pubescent. Sepals free; dorsal sepal erect, often concave; lateral sepals spreading. Petals often connivent with dorsal sepal and forming a hood; lip entire or 3- or 4-lobed, spurred at base or rarely spurless; spur usually as long as ovary. Column stout; anther erect, base firmly adnate to apex of column, with 2 parallel locules; pollinia 2, granular-farinaceous, sectile, each attached to a viscidium by a slender caudicle; each viscidium enclosed in a sticky globe, both globes enclosed in a common bursicle formed by folding of rostellar arms; stigma concave, beneath rostellum; rostellum protruding, with 2 arms; auricles 2, usually prominent, one on each side of column. Capsule erect.
  "Reference": "From observations of many fresh flowers of this genus in the field, we infer that the bursicle formed by the rostellar arms is solitary but later becomes separate.From observations of many fresh flowers of this genus in the field, we infer that the bursicle formed by the rostellar arms is solitary but later becomes separate.
