8.**Huperzia appressa** (Desvaux) Á. Löve & D. Löve Bot. Not. 114: 34. 1961.

> *Huperzia appressa* is often treated as a variety, subspecies, form, or synonym of *H. selago*. However, Ji et al.’s (China J. Chin. Mat. Med. 32: 1971-1975. 2007) *matK* data show that *H. appressa* deserves to be treated at the specific rank.The leaf margins of *Huperzia appressa* are involute, and the leaf apex is acuminate.*“Lycopodium selago* f. *reductum”* and *“L. selago* f. *angustius”* (Christ, Boll. Soc. Bot. Ital. 1898: 184. 1898) belong here but are nomina nuda and were not therefore validly published (*Melbourne Code*, Art. 38.1(a)). These “formae” have sometimes been misinterpreted as a hyphenated forma: f. *reductum*-*angustius*.
