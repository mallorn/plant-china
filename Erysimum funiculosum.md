紫花糖芥",
5.**Erysimum funiculosum** J. D. Hooker & Thomson",

> Although &lt;I&gt;Erysimum absconditum&lt;/I&gt; was described in 1931 from a specimen collected in Xizang, the name was not listed in FRPS or Fl. Xizang. (vol. 2. 1985). Both floras recognized &lt;I&gt;E. chamaephyton&lt;/I&gt;, but the type of this name is indistinguishable in every aspect from that of &lt;I&gt;E. funiculosum&lt;/I&gt;, which was previously considered to be endemic to Sikkim.

## Description
Herbs perennial, (1.5-)2-6(-8) cm tall; caudex several branched, covered with petiolar remains of previous years. Trichomes malpighiaceous, very rarely with a few 3-forked ones on leaves adaxially. Stems 1 to several from base, leafless or few leaved. Basal leaves rosulate; petiole (0.2-)0.5-2 cm; leaf blade oblong-linear or oblanceolate-linear, (0.4-)1-4 cm × 1.5-3.5(-5) mm, base attenuate, margin entire or rarely denticulate, apex acute. Racemes corymbose, not elongated or only slightly elongated in fruit, ebracteate or only lowermost flowers bracteate. Fruiting pedicels divaricate, (3-)4-7(-10) mm, stout, narrower than fruit, straight. Sepals narrowly oblong, 5-6.5 mm, sometimes persistent, lateral pair saccate. Petals pink, narrowly spatulate, 7-9(-10) × 1.7-2(-2.5) mm; claw subequaling sepals. Filaments 4-6 mm; anthers oblong, 1-1.4 mm. Ovules (12-)16-30 per ovary. Fruit oblong-linear, 4-angled, (1-)1.5-2(-2.3) cm × 2.5-3 mm, not torulose, slightly curved; valves slightly keeled, with a prominent midvein, outside with malpighiaceous trichomes, inside glabrous; style 0.5-1 mm; stigma prominently 2-lobed, lobes subdecurrent Seeds ovoid-oblong, 1.5-2 × 0.8-1 mm, on filiform funicles to 6 mm.
